They said Clinton was making \"excellent progress\" and had not suffered any neurological damage.</p><p>Clinton was admitted to New York-Presbyterian hospital on Sunday after doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam to a concussion she suffered in mid-December. </p><p>Initially, few details were released about her condition. But late on Monday, Dr Lisa Bardack of the Mt Kisco Medical Group and Dr Gigi El-Bayoumi of George Washington University released a statement that gave the location of the clot.</p><p>\"In the course of a routine follow-up MRI on Sunday, the scan revealed that a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis had formed. This is a clot in the vein that is situated in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear,\" they said.</p><p>\"To help dissolve this clot, her medical team began treating the secretary with blood thinners. She will be released once the medication dose has been established. In all other aspects of her recovery, the secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery.\" </p><p>Clinton fell and suffered a concussion in mid-December while at home recuperating from a stomach virus that had left her severely dehydrated. Her condition prevented her from attending a congressional hearing into the deadly assault on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya. She also cancelled a trip to North Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Doctors discovered the clot on Sunday and admitted her to hospital for treatment.</p><p>Dr Larry Goldstein, a neurologist and director of Duke University\\'s stroke center, said her condition was \"not the most common thing\" to happen after a concussion.</p><p>He told the Associated Press that the area where Clinton\\'s clot developed is \"a drainage channel, the equivalent of a big vein inside the skull it\\'s how the blood gets back to the heart\". </p><p>Clinton\\'s condition has led to speculation in private, if not in public, from Democrats keen to see her run for the presidency in 2016.</p><p>Bill Galston, a former aide to President Bill Clinton, told the Guardian that health considerations could form part of her decision on whether to run. \"She has run herself ragged for four years and she knows how much physical stamina it requires to campaign,\" said Galston, now a political analyst at Washington-based thinktank the Brookings Institution.</p><p>\"Having said that, she is tough as nails and it is important not to make too much of what, in all probability, is a short-term illness,\" he added.</p><p>Clinton is due to step down as secretary of state in early 2013. The White House has named senator John Kerry, a former presidential nominee and current chair of the Senate\\'s foreign relations committee, as Barack Obama\\'s choice to replace her.</p><p>It has been widely expected that Clinton would start preparing for a White House run. She has strong support among Democrats, and some senior Republican figures have openly pondered if she would present an unbeatable candidate.</p><p>Clinton has alluded to the effects of her heavy travel burden as secretary of state. Asked early last year of her intentions after the 2012 presidential election, she replied: \"I think after 20 years, and it will be 20 years, of being on the high wire of American politics and all of the challenges that come with that, it would probably be a good idea to just find out how tired I am.\"</p><p>Clinton has not been seen in public since the first week of December. She was unable to attend congressional hearings into scathing report into the Benghazi attack, which killed the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stephens. The report highlighted serious failures in two State Department bureaus that led to insufficient security at the consulate.</p><p>The inability of Clinton to attend evidence-giving sessions about the issue in Congress led some rightwing commentators to question the seriousness of her condition.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Hillary+Clinton&k=Obama+administration&k=United+States&k=World+news&k=New+York&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401744287|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|70cfb1709c82fc8a5dd1a110754e9ba78a1d9477 -->',\n",

This past year, I\\'ve contributed a fair share of columns that I think were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/07/mitt-romney-seal-deal-christian-right\">quite</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/28/hurricane-sandy-powerful-storm-perspective\">good</a>, but I\\'ve also written some columns that could have been better. I believe that any good analysts must learn from his or her errors. So here, without further ado, is where I rip myself a new one in the hope that I won\\'t make similar mistakes in 2013.</p><p>I started off 2012 by <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/01/what-the-polls-can-and-cant-tell-us.html\">predicting that Mitt Romney</a> would &quot;probably win [the] Iowa [caucus]&quot;. He had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2012#Iowa_.28January_3.29\">lead in the polls</a>, and he led after the election night count. Unfortunately for me, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Iowa,_2012#Republican_caucuses\">re-tally revealed</a> that Rick Santorum was victorious. I\\'m happy I qualified my prediction with the word &quot;probably&quot;, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/27/which-pollster-performed-best-gop-primaries\">primary polls are by no means perfect</a>.</p><p>The next week, I wrote my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/10/obamas-reelection-prospects-hard-numbers\">first column</a> for the Guardian. I said that growth in real disposable personal income made Obama an &quot;economic&quot; underdog. What I failed to mention was that other economic variables such as gross domestic product were less clear. I had spoken about <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2011/11/presidential-models-have-very-different.html\">these differences previously</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/01/obama-v-romney-economic-matchup\">did so in later columns</a>.</p><p>My bloopers continued in February, thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/11/same-sex-marriage-amendment-ballots\">Minnesota same-sex marriage amendment</a>. I was right that North Carolina would ban same-sex marriage, though I was dead wrong about the Minnesota constitutional ban. Polling had, in past years, seen the banning side gain as the election came closer. In Minnesota, the opposite happened. No to the ban picked up steam, and the demographic regression model that worked so well in North Carolina overestimated the ban vote in Minnesota. I did correct my Minnesota folly in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/same-sex-marriage-ballot-measures-2012\">September article</a>.</p><p>March was fairly kind to me, yet even then, I had a busted call when I listed the possible vice-presidential candidates for the Romney ticket. I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/26/mitt-romney-choose-vp-running-mate\">thought Romney would go with</a> a swing stater, Rob Portman, or with Marco Rubio to appeal to Latinos. I did have Romney\\'s eventual selection, Paul Ryan, on my long list. Clearly, I should have moved him up higher than that. It just goes to prove that it\\'s easier to predict the masses than it is one man, especially when we have limited information.</p><p>Nothing in April or May stands out as that bad, despite an occasional grammatical or spelling error. Speaking of grammatical and spelling errors, I check and re-check. Sometimes, all that probing just doesn\\'t do the trick. I\\'ll re-read my pieces more closely this upcoming year. But you can blame my editor, also.</p><p>Alas, spelling was the least of my problems in June. On the first of the month, I appeared in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/video/2012/jun/01/may-us-jobs-report-economy-election-video\">short video</a> about how unemployment helped or hurt Obama\\'s re-election chances. I like others were giving too much credence to individual jobs reports and their effect on the polls. The good news is that I learned on the fly and didn\\'t make the mistake again. </p><p>Later in the month, I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/22/follow-the-news-election-2012\">wrote a piece on how news-watching patterns</a> in the early summer forecasted eventual election results. There was only one problem \\u2013 attention paid to the news was non-predictive in 2012. Yes, Romney folks were far more enthusiastic and paying closer to attention to the news. That\\'s why <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/27/us-elections-2012-lessons\">Romney supporters were making the likely voter screen cut in October</a>, while Obama supporters were not. It didn\\'t matter, as Obama got his &quot;unenthused&quot; voters out to the polls. </p><p>Jumping ahead to August, I argued that the percentage of non-white Hispanic voters in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">2012 wouldn\\'t decrease from 2008</a>. That was based partially on a miscalculation of previous exit poll data and partially on the pre-election polls at the time. Either way, it was <em>wrong</em>. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/09/white-voter-decline-2012-conundrum\">question that does linger</a> is whether whites were a lower percentage because of increased black or Hispanic turnout.</p><p>September, October, and November were pretty good months. Nothing stands out as a post where I should really say, &quot;I missed it.&quot; Indeed, it seems I made fewer &quot;D\\'oh!&quot; statements as the year progressed.</p><p>Still, I managed to close out 2012 by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22forecasternenten%22+%22over%22+%22snow%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;tbo=d&amp;rls=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22ForecasterEnten:+I+took+the+under+on+the+1-3+inches+in+NYC+on+Wednesday+from+the+NWS.+I%27ll+take+the+over+on+their+2-3+inch+call+right+now.%22&amp;oq=%22ForecasterEnten:+I+took+the+under+on+the+1-3+inches+in+NYC+on+Wednesday+from+the+NWS.+I%27ll+take+the+over+on+their+2-3+inch+call+right+now.%22&amp;gs_l=serp.3...10707.11593.7.11801.3.3.0.0.0.0.128.128.0j1.1.0.les%3Bcpsugrpq2high..0.2...1.1j2.uXf71b0hgnY&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.dmQ&amp;fp=b99e19773a022644&amp;bpcl=40096503&amp;biw=1018&amp;bih=876\">predicting on Twitter</a> that New York City would receive at least 3in of snow on 29 December. <a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=OKX&amp;product=PNS&amp;format=txt&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=0\">Some portions of the Bronx did so</a>, but honestly, I was talking about Central Park. Central Park received less than an inch as the warm air from the ocean made it further inland than I\\'d thought, and <a href=\"http://www.americanwx.com/bb/index.php/topic/38568-1229-winter-storm-obsdisco-part-ii/page__st__1330#entry1971745\">a precipitation hole</a> that was slated to factor in western New England ended up over New York. </p><p>So, my 2012 ended just as it began \\u2013 with an error. I\\'ll never be perfect, even as I hope to get better when the calendar flips to 2013. In which case, I want to thank all of you for telling me when I am off the mark. I have the great pleasure of doing what I do, and I want to do it to the best of my ability.</p><p>Your constructive criticism is appreciated. But in any case, any harsh words you have for me are nothing compared to what my eighth-grade English teacher said about my writing.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\"> <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&amp;partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&amp;k=United+States&amp;k=US+politics&amp;k=World+news&amp;k=Mitt+Romney&amp;k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&amp;k=Barack+Obama\" style=\"border: none\"> &lt;a href=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; alt=&quot;Ads by The Guardian&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </iframe> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401728976|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|e09a7d129f0643f1350957258518573d02a4ab9d -->',\n",

The Vatican also hired a former Fox News correspondent to bring their communications strategy into the 21st century, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/jon-stewart-fox-news-election-meltdown-video_n_2092224.html\">since that network did such an impressive job during the 2012 US presidential election</a>. </p><p>The Catholic Church is foundering, and it\\'ll take a lot more than 140 characters and a rightwing &quot;news&quot; hack to put it on a modern track. </p><p>The pope is a social issues guy, more interested in themes like &quot;traditional&quot; family values, gay marriage and abortion than, say, helping the poor. And the Vatican is quick to slap down anyone \\u2013 but especially any women, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/us/nuns-speak-about-vatican-criticism.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;\">particularly women who have the nerve to think of themselves as equal to men</a> \\u2013 who focuses on helping the most in need, instead of crusading against abortion and gay people. As far as the Church is concerned, advocating for the equal participation of women is &quot;radical feminism&quot; worthy of condemnation; pushing for legislation that kills gay people is <a href=\"http://www.glaad.org/blog/pope-blesses-champion-ugandas-kill-gays-bill\">worthy of a meeting with a proponent</a>. </p><p>Yes, that\\'s correct: just around the same time the pope was drafting his first tweet, he met with Ugandan parliamentary speaker Rebecca Kadaga, who had earlier promised to level the death penalty for gays as a &quot;Christmas present&quot; to the Ugandan people (minus, one assumes, the Ugandans who will be murdered because of their sexual orientation). She was part of a delegation from Uganda which greeted the Pope during a public audience. <a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/638115-speaker-kadaga-receives-blessings-from-pope.html\">Ugandan media sources reported</a> that Kadaga had received the pope\\'s &quot;blessing&quot;, but <a href=\"http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-36233\">this was denied by a Vatican spokesman who insisted</a> the meeting was not a &quot;sign of approval of the actions or proposals of Ms Kadaga&quot;.</p><p>Uganda has been a target for western evangelicals who see that they\\'re losing the gay marriage battle in their own countries. Religious leaders and rightwing groups, including Rick Warren and the National Organization for Marriage, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/world/africa/04uganda.html\">have gone to Uganda for years</a> to spread anti-gay propaganda and bolster homophobia. These religious leaders position themselves as experts, telling Ugandans that gay people sodomize children, spread Aids, destroy marriage, break up families and pose an imminent threat to society \\u2013 and then they feign shock when Ugandan leaders decide that the legal punishment most befitting these child-raping, society-crushing individuals is death.</p><p>In the meantime, gay, lesbian and transgender Ugandans face vigilante attacks daily, and are routinely raped, beaten, ostracized, tortured and murdered. </p><p>The pope \\u2013 whose own track record on men who sodomize children isn\\'t exactly stellar \\u2013 meets one of the people whose hateful policies not only provide social cover and justification for that violence but, if enacted, would put state power behind the imprisonment and execution of gay people.</p><p>The Church\\'s obsession with policing sexuality is nothing new: in fact, it\\'s a centuries-old Catholic tradition for the Vatican to poke its nose in your bedroom when it feels its power is threatened. The early anti-sex crusades were focused on women \\u2013 and haven\\'t let up. Women were ordered to serve their husbands and were barred from the priesthood. Abortion was debated in Thomas Aquinas\\'s day \\u2013 he thought the act was a sin against the marriage, and that, of course, male fetuses were ensouled earlier than female ones \\u2013 and for a long while, the Church distinguished between early and late-term abortions in terms of punishment.</p><p>But as the papal states lost territory to Italy in the late 19th century, the pope came down hard on women, declaring all abortion to be murder. The Church, it seems, is a bit like a schoolyard bully, needing to pick a scapegoat to demonstrate its ultimate authority. Women have spent the past several centuries serving as that target. </p><p>The Church extended its reach into the sex lives of its followers (and of women, in particular) again in the 1930s, when it issued its ruling on contraception for the first time ever and deemed birth control incompatible with Catholic teachings on life. Right around that same time, the Church was dealing with what it called the &quot;terrible triangle&quot; of anti-religious and anti-Catholic actions in the Soviet Union, Mexico and Spain. Desperate for a way to show its power and control followers, the Vatican decided that it was wrong to use anything other than crossed fingers to control the number and spacing of your children. </p><p>Here\\'s how successful they were: <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/charts-birth-control-statistics-catholics\">99% of American women use birth control</a> at some point in their lives, and Catholic women use birth control at the same rates as non-Catholics. In nations where Catholicism is deeply entrenched and abortion is illegal and birth control difficult to access, abortion rates are some of the highest in the world. The only difference is that far more of the procedures are unsafe, and tens of thousands of women die. The lowest abortion rates in the world can be found in the increasingly secular west European countries where the procedure is legal and often covered by state funds, and where birth control is widely accessible. </p><p>Realizing it was losing followers and that most women weren\\'t going to comply with the birth control mandate, and recognizing the social upheavals taking place through the 1960s, the Church re-evaluated its position \\u2013 and doubled down. Pope Paul VI\\'s 1968 encyclical <em>Humanae Vitae</em> restated the Church\\'s anti-contraception position, extended it to sterilization and threw in some claims about the natural roles of women and men. (The natural role of celibate men who spend very little time with women is, apparently, to tell all women what to do.)</p><p>The Church also took a stand against abortion again, and declared that abortion couldn\\'t even be had in the case of an ectopic pregnancy where the fertilized egg will never develop into a fetus. In the late 1980s, under pressure from the many nuns who have kept the Church functioning for centuries and were pushing for equal rights and recognition, Pope John Paul II asserted that women simply served a &quot;different&quot; role in the Church than men, but one that was equally as important. It was a nice little head-pat to Catholic women, but ultimately a condescending one: does anyone actually believe that there\\'s power in subservience, and that being blocked from all positions of real authority represents equal importance?</p><p>In 1995, again facing declining congregations, Pope John Paul II re-upped the Church\\'s hostility toward contraception, and further asserted that condoms were verboten \\u2013 at the very moment HIV and Aids were ravaging nations around the world. The Church, ironically, categorizes contraception and condoms as part of the &quot;culture of death&quot;.</p><p>By the Vatican\\'s standards, taking a birth control pill or using a condom is far more deadly than contracting HIV, or executing an actual person for being gay. </p><p>As society has progressed, the Church has responded by digging its heels in to maintain outdated, misogynist social norms. And it has long used women\\'s bodies as a tool through which to exercise control in the face of waning influence. Now, gay people are being subjected to the same treatment. As the Church continues to recover from the international pedophilia scandal that its priests perpetrated and the entire institution covered up, and as the world\\'s population <a href=\"http://digitaljournal.com/article/331306\">increasingly flees</a> from formal religion, <a href=\"http://richarddawkins.net/news_articles/2012/12/25/pope-benedict-denounces-gay-marriage-during-his-annual-christmas-message#.UN9gGLbAmWw\">the pope is saying that two men or two women falling in love threatens world peace</a>. </p><p>A Twitter feed can\\'t modernize an institution so out of touch with reality, with progress and with widely-accepted human rights norms. </p><p>If the Church really wants to modernize, it could take a stand for the rights of half the world\\'s population, and give women equal say in the Catholic hierarchy and over basic rights to their own bodies. It could promote condom use to save lives. It could take a good hard look at how its hunger for power and its authoritarianism enabled and covered for sex criminals who targeted vulnerable children.</p><p>It could back up out of our bedrooms and quit meddling in national politics, leaving its believers the right to practice as they wish, without imposing its strictures on the rest of us. It could put its enormous resources behind tried-and-true Jesus stuff like helping the sick and indigent, rather than waging battles against nuns who don\\'t hate gays enough. </p><p>I\\'m not holding my breath for any of that. But at the very least, the pope could refuse to meet leaders who want to murder gay, lesbians and transgender people for the simple crime of existing.</p><p>&quot;Gay people have a right to life and dignity, and I oppose their persecution. #uganda,&quot; he could tweet.</p><p>And that\\'s only 84 characters.</p><p>\\u2022 Editor\\'s note: &quot;The disgrace of Church backing for Ugandan homophobia&quot; was amended because the original headline \\u2013 &quot;The disgrace of papal blessing for Ugandan homophobia&quot; \\u2013 and the text incorrectly suggested that the Ugandan parliamentary speaker, Rebecca Kadaga, had received a private audience with the pope and a blessing.

But it wasn\\'t so it hasn\\'t. That contest was the least close election that the world\\'s hyperbolic media could justify defining as close. It was only neck and neck if one of the runners was a giraffe. And, similarly, 2013 has been kind of OK. Massive for some, undoubtedly \\u2013 those that were born or died during it, for example. And that man in the midwest who grew a mole in the shape of the year\\'s digits and was briefly worshipped as a harbinger of the apocalypse before he had it removed. God bless Medicare.</p><p>But for most of us, it has been as unremarkable as anything that lasts such a long time can ever be \\u2013 to paraphrase reviews of <em>The Hobbit</em>. Nevertheless there have been a few interesting developments during it. The death of the phrase &quot;Two thousand and\\u2026&quot; for referring to a year, for example. From about March onwards it was &quot;20-13&quot; all the way \\u2013 despite the risk of sounding like nearly a quarter past eight to military types and the French.</p><p>&quot;It was fine when the last number was \\'12\\' \\u2013 that\\'s only got one syllable so you\\'ve got a bit more time to say \\'two thousand and\\' if that\\'s your bag. But \\'13\\' is a bit of a mouthful and people are busy,&quot; commented Lembit Opik, who wasn\\'t. He continued: &quot;I suppose you\\'re thinking, \\'How come they were OK with &quot;two thousand and 11&quot;? Eleven\\'s got three syllables.\\' Well, things moved at a slower pace back then \\u2013 that was two iPhones ago. I\\'ve given this a lot of thought.&quot;</p><p>Other than contemplation of minor linguistic shifts, what else? Well, there\\'s <em>that</em> obviously. That happened. No need to go into that here but, well you know \\u2026 I mean, Christ. But what of the smaller stories, the quirkier news, of the last 12 months?</p><h2><strong>Gary McKinnon wins <em>The X Factor</em></strong></h2><p>The <em>Daily Mail</em>\\'s ferocious campaign in support of the former computer hacker had so much momentum left when he\\'d won his battle against extradition that a new outlet for the public\\'s enthusiasm had to be found. Encouraging him to enter ITV\\'s beleaguered reality show proved the perfect solution and, while the systems analyst showed little grasp of tune, his obsessively intense mastery of rhythm soon won the nation\\'s hearts. His energetic cover of Tubthumping by Chumbawamba was a memorable Christmas No 1.</p><h2><strong>Shakespeare suspected of touching teens</strong></h2><p>As Operation Yewtree had its remit further extended and acquired the services of 400 historians, yet more shameful allegations about Britain\\'s show business past emerged, including the suggestion, inferred from the stated age of Juliet in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, that William Shakespeare may once have touched a teen\\'s boob. The consequent fury at the Bard\\'s betrayal of public trust led to a flurry of questions: should he have his knighthood posthumously removed? Who forgot to give him a knighthood? Can he be given one posthumously? Is Shakespeare too talented to be retrospectively shamed? This led to a <em>Guardian</em> editorial calling for a formula to be devised that would balance a dead public figure\\'s alleged abuses with their artistic achievements and then tell us whether or not we have to take all their statues down: &quot;Jimmy Savile\\'s talents as a performer frankly wouldn\\'t excuse him so much as a cheeky knee squeeze. The likes of Shakespeare, Beethoven or JK Rowling can have done whatever the hell they liked.&quot;</p><h2><strong>The Real Full Monty fetches &pound;2.3m at Sotheby\\'s</strong></h2><p>In a sale of film memorabilia, the no clothes the cast of hit Britcom <em>The Full Monty</em> wore at the film\\'s climax were the star attraction. There was some controversy when the winning bidder said he thought he was buying the clothes the metal-workers had discarded earlier in the scene. &quot;I\\'d wanted to get my hands on Robert Carlyle\\'s pants,&quot; complained the anonymous millionaire. A Sotheby\\'s spokesman clarified: &quot;This lot isn\\'t the clothes they weren\\'t wearing at the end \\u2013 this is the no clothes they were.&quot; Asked if it was a bit &quot;emperor\\'s new clothes&quot;, he said that &quot;couldn\\'t be further from the truth. That emperor was a nude man claiming to be wearing clothes. The absence of clothes in this lot isn\\'t something we\\'re denying \\u2013 it\\'s something we\\'re celebrating. This is a chance to buy not only a unique, and easily storable, piece of film history but also a share in the very concept of nudity.&quot;</p><h2><strong>Reading tourist board sues actress Emilia Fox</strong></h2><p>&quot;Reading, gardening and butterflies.&quot; That was the answer that an article on the BBC News website in December 2012 quoted Emilia Fox as giving to the question: &quot;Tell me three things that you like.&quot; The Reading tourist board seized on this rare vote of confidence with a high-profile campaign heavily focusing on the popular actress. It was only when the hoardings were up, the local TV commercial shot and the adverts placed in magazines that a videotape of the original interview, which Fox had given nearly three years earlier, emerged. The head of the tourist board explained his horror: &quot;She said \\'reading\\' to rhyme with \\'weeding\\'. The capital letter was only there because it was the start of a sentence. Or what passes for a sentence these days \\u2013 there was no verb.&quot; He explained his decision to take legal action: &quot;It\\'s negligence, pure and simple. She knew there could have been transcripts. She could so easily have said, \\'Gardening, reading and butterflies\\' and there would have been no confusion.&quot;</p><h2><strong>Schadenfreude bounce in economy follows Clarkson driving ban</strong></h2><p>The 200-point rise in the FTSE 100 share index on the day last June that Jeremy Clarkson was banned from driving gave economic theorists a lot to think about. &quot;People just loved that story \\u2013 it was the perfect misfortune for that public figure to undergo and the schadenfreude seriously lifted the public mood for several hours, which added billions to stock prices\\u2026 Markets are emotional places and we can\\'t underestimate the importance of this sort of boost at difficult times like these,&quot; said a leading analyst from HSBC. The government was quick to see the potential of this insight and over the next few weeks Cheryl Cole suffered an outbreak of Bell\\'s palsy, Seb Coe dramatically succumbed to male pattern baldness and Eamonn Holmes got stuck for several hours in the doorway of a branch of Greggs.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007351725\" title=\"\"><em>David Mitchell\\'s autobiography, Back Story</em></a><em>, is out now</em></p><div class=\"gu_advert\"> <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&amp;partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&amp;k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\"> &lt;a href=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; alt=&quot;Ads by The Guardian&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </iframe> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401640733|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|af886086a7f417985eebbb2dcb6e954163aa7800 -->',\n",

Hillary has a present, but she\\'ll only be able to give it to you in about 4 years ...&quot; And after 20 years in Washington, 2012 was the year Clinton officially became hip, with her own viral internet meme, a parody Tumblr site called Texts from Hillary.</p><p>All of which, bizarrely, could doom a&nbsp;potential Clinton candidacy.</p><p>For those who watched Clinton\\'s first run for the White House, the clamour for her to run again, the idea that there is no one more entitled than she is to the&nbsp;nomination and then the White House, is beginning to sound depressingly familiar.</p><p>When she launched her last bid for the White House in January 2007, Clinton was the ultimate establishment candidate: cautious, calculating, hawkish on defence (to the point of voting for the war in Iraq), and reactive rather than breaking new ground. The webcast announcing her presidential exploratory committee said it all \\u2013 the nomination was Clinton\\'s for the taking. &quot;I\\'m in to win,&quot; she said in the video. But of course, she didn\\'t.</p><p>But Clinton has a chance, if she wants it, to show she has learned from the strategic and tactical errors of 2008. She has gained two big pluses in her four years at the State Department. The first is a cause bigger than herself, in her work for women\\'s rights. The second is an ability to reach out beyond a narrow circle of advisers \\u2013 engaging ordinary members of the public on her frequent trips as secretary and commanding the loyalty of a large bureaucratic organisation like the State Department.</p><p>Her ultra-cautious handlers give every impression they are guarding her image for a future run for the presidency. But Clinton, for the moment, isn\\'t telling. She has spoken in interviews of taking time off, writing a memoir, teaching a class or engaging in philanthropic endeavours. Former aides and colleagues mention the possibility of a foundation, in tandem with her husband\\'s <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">Clinton Global Initiative</a>, or a thinktank on women and security. But it is hard to imagine Clinton willingly walking away from a public that, after all the years of flak and controversy, is now almost universally adoring.</p><p>As secretary of state she shed the political baggage accumulated as an activist first lady, and has so far avoided any blowback for the administration\\'s failures in the Middle East and Libya. Her domestic approval ratings are at a lifetime high, above 65%. When she goes abroad, world leaders are gushing in their praise. In September, during United Nations week, one of Clinton\\'s last set-piece events before standing down as secretary of state, there were standing ovations before she even got up to speak, and emotional tributes from a succession of world leaders.</p><p>At the launch of a US-backed initiative to expand women\\'s rights, Clinton perched in the middle of 12 red-and-gilt-arm chairs as a dozen presidents and prime ministers offered up their homages. &quot;Hillary, you have done so much to inspire women and girls around the world,&quot; Australia\\'s prime minister, Julia Gillard, said. &quot;We stand taller and move freer because of your inspiring example.&quot; Clinton did not appear embarrassed. She been hearing such effusive praise for years.</p><p>So what could keep her from running?&nbsp;Voter fatigue with Obama and the Clintons, the economic downturn, and the security failures at Benghazi (when four Americans, including the US&nbsp;ambassador to Libya, were killed in&nbsp;an attack on the US consulate in September this year) could all cause her&nbsp;problems. There is also the question of Clinton\\'s health. The secretary has&nbsp;not been seen in public since 10&nbsp;December. Aides said she fainted and&nbsp;suffered concussion after being weakened by a stomach virus. And though she was quick to tell Barbara Walters in a year-end interview that she&nbsp;was full of &quot;incredible stamina and energy&quot;, Clinton will be 69 at the time of&nbsp;the next elections.</p><p>It would be dangerous for Clinton to take her high approval ratings for granted. The role of secretary of state operates at a remove from domestic politics; for now, Obama or house leader Nancy Pelosi are the main targets of conservative commentators. But if Clinton were to run for the White House, she would open herself up once again to a full-on attack from the right.</p><p>For now, Clinton leaves the State Department with a strong reputation \\u2013 thanks in large part to the efforts of a personal staff that has been tending her image for years or even decades. A number of Clinton\\'s team have worked for her or her husband for most of their adult lives. The communications team, headed by Philippe Reines operates out of a ground floor office of the State Department. Staff make no secret of their mission. Fanned out on the coffee table, when I visited last autumn, were a&nbsp;series of magazines with flattering portraits of the secretary on their covers: Clinton gazing at the Taj Mahal on a travel publication, Clinton in a glamorous black-and-white portrait.</p><p>The secretary\\'s aides decided early on that when it came to repairing the US\\'s battered image in the world, Clinton was her country\\'s best asset. No previous secretary of state could match her charisma or resume: first lady, senator and, at her political height, presidential candidate who won 18m votes in the toughest, most gruelling campaign in modern US history.</p><p>&quot;No one really quibbles with the underlying notion that, since [President Obama] took office and named her as secretary, America has greatly improved and restored its standing in the world,&quot; said Reines. &quot;It is not an image thing. It is not a popularity thing. It is a necessity and prerequisite to getting work done that needs to be done to advance interests and values of the United States.&quot;</p><p>And so Clinton put herself out there, like an old-style politician using her celebrity and personal connections to try to smooth over the rough years of the US\\'s relations with the rest of the world. She logged 956,000 miles as secretary of state, visiting 112 countries, according to the State Department website. On virtually every visit, Clinton made a point of reaching beyond the stilted, formal diplomatic encounters to meet women\\'s groups, health workers, environmentalists, students, business leaders, and to spend time with US embassy staff.</p><p>This constant campaigning for America didn\\'t hurt Clinton\\'s future political prospects, either. Clinton\\'s team went out of their way to promote an image of Clinton, not just as the nation\\'s top diplomat, but its top &quot;gal pal&quot; \\u2013 someone everyone would want to hang out with. She appeared on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xlCNf0MwCU\" title=\"\">comedy sketch with Australian duo Hamish &amp; Andy</a>. She sent in a response and posed for photos with the creators of the <a href=\"http://textsfromhillaryclinton.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Tumblr parody Texts from Hillary</a>, which featured the secretary running the world and sending badass tweets from behind dark sunglasses. She even joked about her fondness for scrunchies, the covered elastics from the 1990s she uses to pull back the longer hair she has favoured as secretary.</p><p>But those hundreds of public encounters during her years as secretary of state also helped Clinton find her way back to a lifelong cause: women\\'s rights. Since her days as a young lawyer, Clinton has cared passionately about the rights of women and children. But until she arrived at the State Department, she was ambivalent about defining herself publicly as a women\\'s advocate.</p><p>She maintained relationships with women\\'s organisations in Africa and Asia that lasted decades, immersing herself in issues such as sex trafficking, violence against women, female genital mutilation, child marriage and women\\'s exclusion from politics.</p><p>&quot;When it really comes to the poor and women\\'s issues, she definitely gives it the topmost priority. She always finds time to go into the depths of it,&quot; said Reema Nanavaty of the <a href=\"http://www.sewa.org/\" title=\"\">Self-Employed Women\\'s Association</a>, who has been in touch with Clinton since 1982. &quot;She shows more of a personal touch.&quot;</p><p>Despite that authentic interest, however, Clinton hesitated to put women\\'s rights centre-stage during her earlier life in elected politics. &quot;She didn\\'t want to just be seen as a woman. She wanted to be seen as the best candidate,&quot; said Neera Tanden, who joined Clinton\\'s staff when she was first lady, and is now president of the leftwing Centre for American Progress think tank.</p><p>Her campaign staff were divided about how to frame Clinton as a candidate. Some feared she was missing a historic opportunity by opting to run as an institutional candidate, rather than as one representing change, a potential first female president. &quot;There was that sense that the first woman president was within our grasp, and we were losing it,&quot; said Patti Solis Doyle, who was removed as Clinton\\'s campaign manager in February 2008.</p><p>But Clinton was swayed by other advisers who warned she could put off male voters. There was also the rampant sexism of the campaigning, the&nbsp;dismissive commentary from TV pundits, the hecklers at campaign events calling for Clinton to iron their&nbsp;shirts.</p><p>Key players in her campaign now acknowledge they got it wrong. &quot;With the benefit of hindsight, there were probably more opportunities to be taken&nbsp;to highlight the change a Clinton presidency would represent \\u2013 as opposed&nbsp;to presenting her as more of an institutional figure,&quot; said Geoff Garin, a&nbsp;Democratic pollster and strategist brought in to manage Clinton\\'s campaign during its final weeks. &quot;I think some of the people who were running her campaign at the time were concerned about the possibility of scaring off men in the general election. But it\\'s clear that as a primary candidate there was, I think, a greater sense of energy and excitement that could have been generated from the historic nature of her candidacy.&quot;</p><p>By the time Clinton came around to embracing the idea of change, it was far too late.</p><p>At the State Department, however, with no immediate political stakes, Clinton felt freer to put women and children at the centre of policy-making. &quot;Hillary came in to the office as an international superstar. I think she could afford to take a little bit more risk on that front,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/experts/democracy-economic-development-middle-east-gender/isobel-coleman/b5206\" title=\"\">Isobel Coleman, director of the women and foreign policy programme at the Council on Foreign Relations</a>. There were still elements of the old political calculation, reminders that Clinton was still keeping options open for 2016. She disappointed activists on her trip to Ireland earlier this month, possibly her last as secretary, when she failed to publicly take up the case of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/16/ireland-abortion-savita-halappanavar-indian-envoy\" title=\"\">Savita Halappanavar</a>, who died after being refused an abortion.</p><p>But Clinton\\'s allies argue her advocacy on women\\'s issues has made&nbsp;a&nbsp;profound difference. &quot;When a secretary of state goes to a country and&nbsp;the embassy gets engaged in those issues again and again and again, I think that is the way you begin to change the mindset,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.vitalvoices.org/node/180\" title=\"\">Alyse Nelson, who runs the Vital Voices</a> group fostered by Clinton when she was first lady. &quot;Hillary&nbsp;took it to a whole new level.&quot;</p><p>When Clinton took the job as secretary of state four years ago, she could have messed up. After all, in the single most important foreign policy vote of her time in the Senate, the decision to invade Iraq, Clinton picked the wrong side, voting for war. There were also concerns about her capacity to&nbsp;work with her former rival Obama. &quot;When she came in she had a very tough political task,&quot; said <a href=\"http://rothkopf.foreignpolicy.com/\" title=\"\">David Rothkopf, chief executive of Foreign Policy</a> magazine. &quot;She was seen as a rival to the&nbsp;president. She had her own political base. She could easily be seen as someone upstaging him, but that didn\\'t&nbsp;happen. She put her head down and she got to work.&quot;</p><p>In 2008, Hillary Rodham Clinton was&nbsp;a flawed candidate. Has she done enough to address those flaws and make&nbsp;it to the White House in 2016? Only time will tell.</p><p>\\u2022 This article was amended on 29 December 2012.

It&nbsp;was a place where magical vaginas&nbsp;could shut down pregnancies; where unwanted pregnancies were a&nbsp;gift from God; where well-qualified women could be found tucked away on office shelves \\u2013 whole binders full of them.&nbsp;Tina Fey compared this dark, cobwebby realm to the 1960s, when&nbsp;she quipped, \"What is happening? Am I a secretary on Mad&nbsp;Men?\" It wasn\\'t a bad calculation, but as Republicans broke out their archaic views, it began to feel a good few centuries too optimistic.</p><p>It was in August that the Grand Old&nbsp;Party should have circulated a memo warning candidates to avoid the subjects of rape and abortion. This was the month Todd Akin, Missouri senate candidate, boggled everyone with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/republican-todd-akin-rape-pregnancy\" title=\"\">his take on female fertility</a>. Asked whether abortion should be allowed when a pregnancy results from rape, he answered, \"From what I understand from doctors, that\\'s really rare. If it\\'s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let\\'s assume that maybe that didn\\'t work or something. I think there should be some punishment. But the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.\" No mention of the woman involved; she could apparently be punished horrifically, no problem.</p><p>The fallout from Akin\\'s comments should have warned fellow candidates. But in October Republican state representative Roger Rivard recounted his father\\'s advice that women often lie about consensual sex, telling a reporter, repeatedly, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/10/10/989981/wisconsin-lawmaker-claims-some-girls-rape-easy/\" title=\"\">\"Some girls, they rape so easy.\"</a> Then it was Republican Joe Walsh, who <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/10/19/rep-joe-walsh-no-abortion-exceptions-because-pregnant-women-dont-die/\" title=\"\">said he was against abortion, without exception</a>, including the life of the mother, on the basis he believes the procedure is never medically necessary.</p><p>Next came Indiana senate candidate Richard Mourdock, asked whether he agreed with abortion being available in cases of rape and incest. \"I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape,\" he said, \"that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/10/23/1078181/gop-us-senate-candidate-calls-rape-pregnancies-a-gift-from-god/\" title=\"\">it is something that God intended to happen.</a>\"</p><p>Despite all this, at the end of the first presidential debate, in early October, Mitt Romney seemed to be swaying the female vote that helped Obama to power. But in the second, addressing a question about equal pay, he talked of his efforts to improve the representation of women as governor of Massachusetts. He had asked women\\'s groups to find candidates for his cabinet, and \"they brought us&nbsp;whole <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/17/binders-full-of-women-romneys-four-words\" title=\"\">binders full of women</a>\".</p><p>The story wasn\\'t true \\u2013 women\\'s groups had been working on the project before his election \\u2013 but that awkward phrase went viral. And, like his colleagues, he couldn\\'t stop pronouncing on women\\'s rights. The binders comment was compounded by his pledge that, in the economy he would build, employers \"are going to be so anxious to get good workers, they\\'re going to be anxious to hire women\". Well, so long as they\\'ve exhausted all other avenues\\u2026</p><p>Thankfully, women weren\\'t anxious to hire any of these guys.

Or sing, in the case of Paul McCartney. Yet despite having dozens of people whose job it is to tell them exactly what to think and say abroad, many&nbsp;politicians and celebs seem unable to stay on message. A failure of ego or intelligence. Or both.</p><p>The world might feel a great deal&nbsp;safer without this year\\'s Republican presidential hopeful, Mitt Romney, but it would also be more boring. In July, Romney headed off to Europe \\u2013 wherever that was \\u2013 in a bid to raise his profile&nbsp;as an international statesman, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney-britain-gaffes\" title=\"\">managed to insult just about everyone he met</a>. He started in London by suggesting that&nbsp;Britain\\'s preparations for the Olympic games were inadequate and \"disconcerting\", before flying to&nbsp;Israel, where he managed to ignore the economic impact of the occupation of the West Bank by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/30/mitt-romney-israel-economic-success\" title=\"\">arguing it was culture that made Israelis wealthier than the Palestinians</a>. To make matters worse, he insisted on calling Jerusalem the \"capital\" of Israel \\u2013 thereby doing even more to undermine the Middle East peace process than Tony Blair.</p><p>If that weren\\'t enough, Romney then went north to Poland, unaware&nbsp;that his anti-trades union rhetoric might not go down all that&nbsp;well with Solidarity, the union that ended Communist rule in 1989.&nbsp;Even Boris Johnson has never&nbsp;managed so many gaffes in one trip, though Romney\\'s crowning&nbsp;glory did come at home when he announced his vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, as the \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/mitt-romney-paul-ryan-mistake_n_1767430.html\" title=\"\">next president of the&nbsp;United States</a>\".</p><p>The actual next president of the US didn\\'t manage to get through the&nbsp;year unscathed, either. On a visit to Burma, President Obama referred&nbsp;to the country as Myanmar,&nbsp;the name given to it by the military junta in 1989 after crushing the pro-democracy movement. This may have been an&nbsp;attempt to recognise the Burmese government\\'s grudging steps towards a more liberal state, but to many of the Burmese people \\u2013&nbsp;not least Aung San Suu Kyi \\u2013 it looked suspiciously like an endorsement of&nbsp;the regime.</p><p>With William Hague strangely quiet, presumably having been sent&nbsp;to remedial classes after sighting Colonel Gadafi in Venezuela last year, it was left to David Cameron to fly the flag for British political incompetence abroad. Cameron\\'s coup de th\\xe9\\xe2tre came with an appearance on the David Letterman show in which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/27/david-cameron-letterman-late-show\" title=\"\">he failed to answer questions on British history</a>. Not knowing who composed Rule Britannia was perhaps forgivable, but not being able to have even a&nbsp;stab at guessing the meaning of Magna Carta was beyond stupid for someone with a classical education. Still, as most of Letterman\\'s audience probably had no idea who Cameron was, he didn\\'t have too much credibility to damage.</p><p>But the year\\'s clear winner for insulting an entire nation has to go to the British organisers of the Olympics for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-north-korea-flag\" title=\"\">raising the South Korean flag</a> at a match involving the&nbsp;North Korean women.

That is to say, there are fewer swing districts. In addition, fewer districts are voting for one party for House and another for president.</p><p>The conclusion one might draw is that many legislators have little reason to play to the middle, and that\\'s why Washington seems more partisan than it used to be.</p><p>A further analysis of statewide results <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/sunday-review/the-vanishing-electoral-battleground.html?hp&amp;_r=2&amp;\">reflects a similar trend</a>.</p><p>Back in 1976, there were near 25 states that came within three points of the nationwide margin and well over 30 that were within five points of the nationwide vote. In <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AjYj9mXElO_QdHpla01oWE1jOFZRbnhJZkZpVFNKeVE&amp;f=true&amp;noheader=true&amp;gid=19\">2012</a>, it was eight states within three points of the nationwide margin and 10 within five points.</p><p>Both of these totals are lower than 2008 and indeed the lowest in the past 50 years. Heck, there were only 14 states out of 50 where the statewide margin came within 10 points of the nationwide margin! Any way you slice it, there are fewer swing states than there used to be.</p><p>This increased polarization has translated to the Senate makeup. After the <a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/103/senate/members/\">1992 elections</a>, when Republicans won 43 seats, 49% of the Democratic caucus came from states that voted more Republican than the country as a whole, while about 28% of the Republican caucus came from states where Bill Clinton won by a greater margin than he did nationwide. After the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/113th_United_States_Congress#Senate\">2012 elections</a>, in which Republicans won a slightly higher 45 seats than 1992, only 25% of the Democratic caucus comes from states where Obama underperformed his national margin, and only 16% of the Republican caucus comes from states Obama won by a greater margin than he did nationally.</p><p>The question that arises is how this increased polarization impacts on the seemingly growing partisanship of Washington. One would expect that it would, given that elected officials care most about getting re-elected and without fear of losing re-election in the general they play to the base to avoid a primary challenge.</p><p>One way we can test this hypothesis is to look at roll call votes. The DW nominate score method puts legislators on a scale from -1 for most liberal to 1 for most conservative. The folks who maintain the system at Voteview have plotted both the House and the Senate over the past 130 years.</p><p>You would think that House Democrats may have become more liberal over the past 20 years, given that they are increasingly safe districts. In 1992, only 51% of the Democratic caucus came from seats that were five points or more Democratic than the nationwide presidential vote. In 2012, 88% of Democrats came from districts won by Obama by five points or more \\u2013 a 37-point increase.</p><p>Interestingly, the scores don\\'t indicate that <a href=\"http://voteview.com/blog/?p=494\">House Democrats</a> have really become any more liberal.</p><p>The average Democrat was a little north of -0.4 after the 1992 elections and right at -0.4 in the last congress. This percentage has been fairly constant for the past 20 years even when the Democrats won more swing and red districts when they won back the majority from 2007 to 2011.</p><p>There has, however, been an increase in partisanship in the house, and it truly is \"asymmetrical\". The Republican House caucus has been becoming more conservative every year since 1977, whether or not House Republicans are winning or losing elections. Republicans have climbed from 0.4 on the DW nominate scales after the 1992 elections to near 0.7 in the last congress. That type of charge towards polarization is historically unusual over data that stretches back 130 years.</p><p>The fact that it is House Republicans who have become more partisan is somewhat surprising given that the party caucus is representing only slightly more Republican territory than it did 20 years ago. The percentage of Republicans representing seats that went for the Republican presidential candidate by five or more points than nationwide only increased from 74% to 90% \\u2013 a 16-point increase. That is far less than the 37-point increase that House Democrats, who aren\\'t much more partisan than used to be, experienced during the same timeframe.</p><p>The Senate picture matches that of the House.</p><p>Senate Democrats, like their House counterparts, are hovering around that -0.4 score \\u2013 as they were 20 years ago. This levelness comes despite the Democratic caucus going from being 50/50 in the percentage of Democratic senators from Democratic-leaning states versus Republican-leaning states to 75/25.</p><p>Republicans, on the other hand, have slowly and become more conservative in their roll call votes by moving from about 0.3 to 0.5 on the scale. You might expect this trend given Republicans are representing more Republican leaning states, but the magnitude is quite noticeable given that the average Democratic ideology during the same period didn\\'t move under polarization.</p><p>Yet, in the Senate, these roll call votes don\\'t tell the whole story. Much of the perception that the Senate is home to partisan gridlock is that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2012/12/27/cloture-votes-do-not-equal-filibusters\"> many bills can\\'t get an up-or-down vote</a>. We can measure this inability by looking at cloture votes to end debate. One must get 60 votes for cloture. When cloture attempts go up, it means that increasingly 60, not 51, votes are needed to pass a bill. Cloture doesn\\'t equal filibuster, but the two are correlated.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/cloture_motions/clotureCounts.htm\"> number of cloture motions</a> since the Democrats took over the Senate in 2007 is 391, an average of 130 per Senate. It would take the last six Senates combined before 2007, that is to say those from 1995 through 2007) to match this total. In the final Senate before the Republicans took over in 1995, there were 80 cloture motions.</p><p>It\\'s not just that Republicans aren\\'t allowing bills to be voted upon in an up-or-down vote, it\\'s that they are blocking bills in far greater numbers than they did 20 years ago.</p><p>When Democrats were in the minority for of the 1995 to 2007 time period, the most cloture motions that were filed in a Senate was 82. Since 2007, the fewest number of clotures in a Senate has been 115. The average number per Senate when Democrats were in the minority was 70 \\u2013 some 50 less than when Republicans were in the minority the past six years.</p><p>Yes, Democrats block bills, but Republicans block many more. This is gridlock at its finest (or worst).</p><p>When you put all these statistics together, the portrait painted becomes rather clear. Polarization is definitely up on the congressional district and state level. Yet, the feeling that Democrats and Republicans are further apart than they used to be is upon inspection of the evidence more because of Republicans than Democrats.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=US+politics&k=US+Congress&k=US+House+of+Representatives&k=US+Senate&k=Republicans&k=Democrats\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401656833|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|bfd45ea980cb0c6620c9987e03c489a15bd0d6a1 -->',\n",

Yet, as this list of the top five polling rules from 2012 will demonstrate, there will always be exceptions to the rule.</p><h2>1. When likely and registered voter polls disagree in high turnout elections, you should usually go with the registered voter surveys</h2><p>Likely voter (LV) models at their heart are trying to separate the LV electorate from the larger registered voter (RV) unit. That just creates unnecessary noise in a presidential year because, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/30/barack-obama-mitt-romney-polls-polling\">I\\'ve noted</a>, almost all RVs cast a ballot.</p><p>This year LV samples were more favorable to Mitt Romney<a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_06/likely_voters_and_gotv037929.php\"> throughout the entire campaign</a>. Among pollsters who conducted a poll among both LVs and RVs in the final week, Obama was ahead in the<a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:orka5LWhwkcJ:https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/272072225497178112+enten+rv+lv&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari\">final LV aggregate</a> by only 1.3 points. The RV average had him by 3.9 points and was thus far more accurate given Obama is leading by 3.7 currently. This follows a trend from <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/23/1149071/-Why-registered-voter-screens-matter-they-ve-been-more-accurate\">past presidential years</a> when RV polls were more accurate than their LV counterparts. </p><p><strong>Exceptions to the rule:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/11/04/obama-gains-edge-in-campaigns-final-days/\">Pew Research\\'s</a> final LV margin of three points for Obama was more accurate than their RV margin of seven points. That\\'s noteworthy because Pew Research has one of the <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/gallup-blew-its-presidential-polls-but-why--20121118\">tighter LV screens</a> in the polling business. Pew\\'s LV success marks three consecutive presidential elections where their LV model was more accurate their RV model. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://mmicdata.rand.org/alp/index.php?page=election\">RAND poll</a> LV model, which allowed voters to assign themselves a percentage likelihood of voting, had Obama leading by 3.3 points and was only 0.4 points off the mark. The RV RAND model had Obama ahead by 6.3 points \\u2013 a 2.6-point error.</p><h2>2. Cellphones are generally needed for an accurate telephone poll</h2><p>If you\\'re trying to poll the overall population, and part of the population no longer has a landline, then you need to call cellphones. This \"fact\" has become <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/hotlineoncall/2012/12/pollsters-cell-phone-problem-getting-worse-23\">especially true as the cellphone-only population explodes</a>, and those with cellphones have different political ideologies even when controlling for demographics. </p><p>During the course of the 2012, polls without cellphones <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/107446/obama-pulling-ahead-in-live-interview-surveys\">consistently painted a false pretty picture</a> for the Romney campaign. Polls without cellphones in the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/which-polls-fared-best-and-worst-in-the-2012-presidential-race/\">final 21 days</a> were more than a point more inaccurate than those that included cellphones. This includes some of the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/12/21/1172477/-Best-public-pollster-of-2012-Public-Policy-Polling\">worst pollsters of 2012</a> such as Gravis and the infamous Rasmussen.</p><p><strong>Exception to the rule:</strong></p><p>Public Policy Polling was arguably the most accurate large-scale pollster of 2012 and didn\\'t compensate for not calling cells by utilizing an internet subsample. Their secret? They simply were able to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/11/polls-in-the-end-ended-up-making-sense.html?mid=twitter_dailyintel\">correctly model the election day electorate</a>, which is what polling is all about.</p><h2>3. Internet polling is the wave of the future</h2><p>Once upon a time, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/09/study-finds-trouble-for-internet-surveys/\">internet polling, and specifically non-probability internet polling, was shunned</a>. Now with cellphones popping up everywhere and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/poll-response-rates_n_1518501.html\">poll response rates plummeting</a>, internet polling has gotten a second look because it\\'s cheap and accurate. Almost all age groups now use the internet and weighting can compensate for people who don\\'t. </p><p>Google, Ipsos, RAND, and YouGov performed <a href=\"fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/which-polls-fared-best-and-worst-in-the-2012-presidential-race/\">at least as well</a> as telephone polls, if not better. RAND was by far the most accurate national pollster of 2012. RAND and YouGov also tended to be <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/23/2012-polling-accuracy_n_2347772.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">stabler than telephone surveys</a> in their results after the first debate. </p><p><strong>Exception to the rule:</strong></p><p>Zogby (JZ Analytics) is awful at internet polling. Their <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-battleground04-frameset.html\">poor performance in 2004</a> delayed the acceptance of internet polling in the mainstream by at least five years, and they were again in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/12/21/1172477/-Best-public-pollster-of-2012-Public-Policy-Polling\">one of the least accurate pollsters</a>.</p><h2>4. Internal polls published publicly generally should not be trusted</h2><p>This one is fairly simple. Internal, or campaign, pollsters usually only release surveys to the public that are most favorable to their candidate. They may also only pass polls to the press that are based on turnout models more favorable than probable for their candidates. </p><p>In 2012, we saw that <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2012/11/30/the_internal_polls_that_made_romney_think_he039d_win_296943.html\">Mitt Romney\\'s internal polls were hilariously bad</a>. We also witnessed that polls conducted for Republican groups such as <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/265355-gop-pollster-romney-up-in-ohio-closing-in-wisconsin\">Citizens United in the swing states</a> that were way off the mark. During the Wisconsin gubernatorial recount, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/09/wisconsin-recall-polls-tom-barrett-partisan-polls_n_1581919.html\">Democratic internal surveys</a> were on average six to seven points more favorable to Democrat Tom Barrett than public polls. </p><p><strong>Exception to the rule:</strong></p><p>Any poll conducted by Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. He was <a href=\"fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/which-polls-fared-best-and-worst-in-the-2012-presidential-race/\">most accurate state pollster of 2012</a>. Mellman is <a href=\"http://www.ralstonflash.com/blog/democratic-pollster-says-obama-6-nevada#.UNuCERx7Tdw\">the only pollster I\\'d trust in the state of Nevada</a> where Latinos are generally undercounted by pollsters. He also did well in North Dakota when <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-north-dakota-senate-berg-vs-heitkamp\">he argued early on</a> that Democratic Senate candidate Heidi Heitkamp was competitive, even though most of us thought she had little chance. </p><h2>5. When state and national polls disagree, you should generally go with the state data</h2><p>The state polling always had President Obama winning a second term and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/07/how-pollsters-won-2012-election-mostly\">state polling averages were correct in 49 or 50 states</a>. The national polling had Romney much closer and even pulling into the lead <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/romney-v-obama-mixed-signals-polls\">after the first debate</a>. It was only in the final week that it became clear judging off the national polls that Obama was going to win the nationwide vote. Even then, 90% of the polls <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/21/2012-election-polling-skewed-for-mitt-romney\">underestimated Obama\\'s lead</a>.</p><p>This was not the first time that national and state polls disagreed. In <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/poll-averages-have-no-history-of-consistent-partisan-bias/\">1996 and 2000</a>, national polling incorrectly had Bill Clinton winning by double digits and George W Bush winning respectively. This year also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/27/swing-state-polling-electoral-college-arithmetic\">continued a streak</a> wherein no presidential candidate won a state where they were not leading in at least one non-partisan statewide poll in the final weeks.</p><p><strong>Exceptions to the rule: </strong></p><p>The state polling was atrocious in a number of states. Twenty-eight of 29 polls <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UVPcTXErFKEJ:https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/271032413684105218+%22virginia%22+%22forecasterenten%22+%22only%22&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari\">in Colorado</a>, 20 out of 21 polls <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lBglRpwyrWQJ:https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/273116365655781376+%22forecasterenten%22+%22michigan%22&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari\">in Michigan</a>, 16 of the 18 polls <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nQTTdaMW-LMJ:twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/statuses/273117803542892544+%22forecasterenten%22+%22nevada%22&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari\">in Nevada</a>, and 33 of the 38 polls <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-virginia-president-romney-vs-obama\">in Virginia</a> during the final month were biased against Obama. Fortunately for pollsters, Obama was leading by a comfortable enough margin in these states that this bias did not effect the projected winner in the polling aggregates.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=United+States&k=US+elections+2012&k=Barack+Obama&k=Mitt+Romney&k=US+politics&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401619197|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|e87fb6463f1fcd192267587c66ea2c498bb86e0a -->',\n",

Taking in previously unseen footage, from home movies to live stand-up material, this profile celebrates the life of the comic actor whose career stretched all the way from Variety Bandbox to 1990\\'s The Craig Ferguson Story (playing The God Of Comedy, no less). Also, a peek at Howerd\\'s extensive correspondence, including exchanges with the likes of Laurence Olivier and Paul McCartney. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2>Miranda<br />9pm, BBC1</h2><p>Of course, Miranda is mainstream, gentle, mum-and-dad comedy. But it is very good mainstream mum-and-dad comedy. As ever, it\\'s Miranda\\'s chronic want of an edit button from which most laughs derive, but in tonight\\'s episode Penny\\'s political aspirations (a right-wing crusade in which she is ably assisted by Tilly) is a great sideshow. Meanwhile, envious of Gary, his new girlfriend Rose and their very public displays of affection, Miranda is spurred into direct action to find a boyfriend: going clubbing. The most over-acted show since Ab Fab \\u2013 but no worse for that. <em>John Robinson</em></p><h2>Charlie Brooker\\'s 2012 Wipe <br />10pm, BBC2</h2><p>As ever in these media-saturated times, there is plenty for Charlie Brooker to sink his satirical teeth into over the last 12 months, though for once, not all of it has been bad. He\\'ll be reflecting on the Olympics, the Queen\\'s Diamond Jubilee, the jailing of members of Pussy Riot and, of course, the US presidential election in which the Republicans both scared us and added to the gaiety of nations. Limmy, Sharon Horgan and Peter Serafinowicz also contribute. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><h2>David Attenborough\\'s Galapagos<br />7pm, Sky 1</h2><p>Not for the first time in his career, Attenborough turns his attention to the islands that did so much to shape Darwin\\'s ideas about evolution. The familiarity of the subject certainly isn\\'t a disincentive, as, over three episodes, Attenborough explores how life has developed within an ever-changing landscape. The result: species that exist nowhere else in the world. Highlights include what\\'s said to be the first-ever images of the pink iguana as well as footage of the late Lonesome George, the world\\'s last-known Pinta Island tortoise. Also shown in 3D. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2>Fifties British War Films: Days Of Glory<br />9pm, BBC4</h2><p>The last shot of World War II had barely ceased echoing before people began making films about the battles they\\'d just endured. Simon Heffer launches BBC4\\'s War Movies season with this reflection on Britain\\'s cinematic takes on its own war experience, with the aid of such veterans of the genre as Donald Sinden and Virginia McKenna. They wonder what the films tell us about Britain back then, and what their enduring popularity says about Britain now. The Wooden Horse follows. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><h2>TNA: British Boot Camp<br />10pm, Challenge</h2><p>TNA (Total Nonstop Action) is an American professional wrestling federation, and here they\\'re on the lookout for a British star to join their circuit. In scenes reminiscent of The Hunger Games, TNA boss Dixie Carter, abetted by Hulk Hogan, addresses the hopefuls, whittled down to four, who will be put through their paces by Mark \"Rollerball\" Rocco, a name familiar to British grapple fans. Among the contenders are \"Rock Star Spud\", a Birmingham stripling who queers his pitch by turning up hungover to the first day at camp. Irresistibly risible stuff. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><h2>Up (Pete Docter, Bob Peterson, 2009)<br />6.30pm, BBC1</h2><p>This immensely charming animation is one of Pixar\\'s finest, centring on the poignant friendship across the age-gulf between curmudgeonly old Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) and chubby, lonely boyscout Russell (Jordan Nagai). Together they set sail \\u2013 in a balloon-powered house \\u2013 for adventure in a South American jungle; it\\'s all about life, loss and chasing that dream, and is sprinkled with pure movie magic. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p><h2>Robin Hood (Ridley Scott, 2010)<br />9pm, Channel 4</h2><p>There\\'s precious little Errol Flynn-style merriment about this Robin: Russell Crowe\\'s beefy bowman is a serious-minded leader of men who not only redistributes wealth to the poor, but stops a full-on French invasion in its tracks and swiftly drafts the Magna Carta. It\\'s a chunky, mead-quaffing, earthy lump of English quasi-history, much imbued with the spirit of Gladiator, with savage action and staunch support from the likes of Cate Blanchett\\'s battling Marian and Mark Strong\\'s villainous Godfrey. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401342402|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|9b66828709510cdee9946578ce380d5252ee2024 -->',\n",

Ailes himself would resign as president of Fox News and run the campaign, according to the conversation between Petraeus and the emissary, K T McFarland, a Fox News on-air defense &quot;analyst&quot; and former spear carrier for national security principals in three Republican administrations.</p><p>All this was revealed in a tape recording of Petraeus\\'s meeting with McFarland obtained by Bob Woodward, whose account of their discussion, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fox-news-chiefs-failed-attempt-to-enlist-petraeus-as-presidential-candidate/2012/12/03/15fdcea8-3d77-11e2-a2d9-822f58ac9fd5_story.html\">accompanied online by audio of the tape</a>, was published in the Washington Post \\u2013 distressingly, in its style section, and not on page one, where it belonged \\u2013 and, under the style logo, online on December 3. </p><p>Indeed, almost as dismaying as Ailes\\' and Murdoch\\'s disdain for an independent and truly free and honest press, and as remarkable as the obsequious eagerness of their messenger to convey their extraordinary presidential draft and promise of on-air Fox support to Petraeus, has been the ho-hum response to the story by the American press and the country\\'s political establishment, whether out of fear of Murdoch, Ailes and Fox \\u2013 or, perhaps, lack of surprise at Murdoch\\'s, Ailes\\' and Fox\\'s contempt for decent journalistic values or a transparent electoral process. </p><p>The tone of the media\\'s reaction was set from the beginning by the Post\\'s own tin-eared treatment of this huge story: relegating it, like any other juicy tidbit of inside-the-beltway media gossip, to the section of the newspaper and its website that focuses on entertainment, gossip, cultural and personality-driven news, instead of the front page. </p><p>&quot;Bob had a great scoop, a buzzy media story that made it perfect for Style. It didn\\'t have the broader import that would justify A1,&quot; Liz Spayd, the Post\\'s managing editor, told Politico when asked why the story appeared in the style section.</p><p>Buzzy media story? Lacking the &quot;broader import&quot; of a front-page story? One cannot imagine such a failure of news judgment among any of Spayd\\'s modern predecessors as managing editors of the Post, especially in the clear light of the next day and with a tape recording \\u2013 of the highest audio quality \\u2013 in hand. </p><p>&quot;Tell [Ailes] if I ever ran,&quot; Petraeus announces on the crystal-clear digital recording and then laughs, &quot;but I won\\'t \\u2026 but if I ever ran, I\\'d take him up on his offer. \\u2026 He said he would quit Fox \\u2026 and bankroll it.&quot;</p><p>McFarland clarified the terms: &quot;The big boss is bankrolling it. Roger\\'s going to run it. And the rest of us are going to be your in-house&quot; \\u2013 thereby confirming what Fox New critics have consistently maintained about the network\\'s faux-news agenda and its built-in ideological bias. </p><p>And here let us posit the following: were an emissary of the president of NBC News, or of the editor of the New York Times or the Washington Post ever caught on tape promising what Ailes and Murdoch had apparently suggested and offered here, the hue and cry, especially from Fox News and Republican/Tea Party America, from the Congress to the US Chamber of Commerce to the Heritage Foundation, would be deafening and not be subdued until there was a congressional investigation, and the resignations were in hand of the editor and publisher of the network or newspaper. Or until there had been plausible and convincing evidence that the most important elements of the story were false. And, of course, the story would continue day after day on page one and remain near the top of the evening news for weeks, until every ounce of (justifiable) piety about freedom of the press and unfettered presidential elections had been exhausted.</p><p>The tape of Petraeus and McFarland\\'s conversation is an amazing document, a testament to the willingness of Murdoch and the wily genius he hired to create Fox News to run roughshod over the American civic and political landscape without regard to even the traditional niceties or pretenses of journalistic independence and honesty. Like the revelations of the hacking scandal, which established beyond any doubt Murdoch\\'s ability to capture and corrupt the three essential elements of the British civic compact \\u2013 the press, politicians and police \\u2013 the Ailes/Petraeus tape makes clear that Murdoch\\'s goals in America have always been just as ambitious, insidious and nefarious.</p><p>The digital recording, and the dead-serious conspiratorial conversation it captures so chillingly in tone and substance (&quot;I\\'m only reporting this back to Roger. And that\\'s our deal,&quot; McFarland assured Petraeus as she unfolded the offer) utterly refutes Ailes\\' disingenuous dismissal of what he and Murdoch were actually attempting: the buying of the presidency. </p><p>&quot;It was more of a joke, a wiseass way I have,&quot; Ailes would later claim while nonetheless confirming its meaning. &quot;I thought the Republican field [in the primaries] needed to be shaken up and Petraeus might be a good candidate.&quot; </p><p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fox-news-chiefs-failed-attempt-to-enlist-petraeus-as-presidential-candidate/2012/12/03/15fdcea8-3d77-11e2-a2d9-822f58ac9fd5_story.html\">The recording</a> deserves to be heard by any open-minded person trying to fathom its meaning to the fullest.</p><p>Murdoch and Ailes have erected an incredibly influential media empire that has unrivaled power in British and American culture: rather than judiciously exercising that power or improving reportorial and journalistic standards with their huge resources, they have, more often than not, recklessly pursued an agenda of sensationalism, manufactured controversy, ideological messianism, and political influence-buying while masquerading as exemplars of a free and responsible press. The tape is powerful evidence of their methodology and reach.</p><p>The Murdoch story \\u2013 his corruption of essential democratic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic \\u2013 is one of the most important and far-reaching political/cultural stories of the past 30 years, an ongoing tale without equal. Like Richard Nixon and his tapes, much attention has been focused on the necessity of finding the smoking gun to confirm what other evidence had already established beyond a doubt: that the elemental instruments of democracy, ie the presidency in Nixon\\'s case, and the privileges of free press in Murdoch\\'s, were grievously misused and abused for their own ends by those entrusted to use great power for the common good. </p><p>In Nixon\\'s case, the system worked. His actions were investigated by Congress, the judicial system held that even the president of the United States was not above the law, and he was forced to resign or face certain impeachment and conviction. American and British democracy has not been so fortunate with Murdoch, whose power and corruption went unchecked for a third of a century.</p><p>The most important thing we journalists do is make judgments about what is news. Perhaps no story has eluded us on a daily basis (for lack of trying) for so many years as the story of Murdoch\\'s destructive march across our democratic landscape. Only the Guardian vigorously pursued the leads of the hacking story and methodically stuck with it for months and years, never ignoring the underlying context of how Rupert Murdoch conducted his take-no-prisoners business and journalism without regard for the most elemental standards of fairness, accuracy or balance, or even lawful conduct.</p><p>When the Guardian\\'s hacking coverage reached critical mass last year, I quoted a former top Murdoch deputy as follows: &quot;This scandal and all its implications could not have happened anywhere else. Only in Murdoch\\'s orbit. The hacking at News of the World was done on an industrial scale. More than anyone, Murdoch invented and established this culture in the newsroom, where you do whatever it takes to get the story, take no prisoners, destroy the competition, and the end will justify the means.&quot;</p><p>The tape that Bob Woodward obtained, and which the Washington Post ran in the style section, should be the denouement of the Murdoch story on both sides of the Atlantic, making clear that no institution, not even the presidency of the United States, was beyond the object of his subversion. If Murdoch had bankrolled a successful Petraeus presidential campaign and \\u2013 as his emissary McFarland promised \\u2013 &quot;the rest of us [at Fox] are going to be your in-house&quot; \\u2013 Murdoch arguably might have sewn up the institutions of American democracy even more securely than his British tailoring.</p><p>Happily, Petraeus was not hungering for the presidency at the moment of the messenger\\'s arrival: the general was contented at the idea of being CIA director, which Ailes was urging him to forgo.</p><p>&quot;We\\'re all set,&quot; said the emissary, referring to Ailes, Murdoch and Fox. &quot;It\\'s never going to happen,&quot; Petraeus said. &quot;You know it\\'s never going to happen. It really isn\\'t. \\u2026 My wife would divorce me.&quot;</p><div class=\"gu_advert\"> <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&amp;partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&amp;k=Rupert+Murdoch&amp;k=David+Petraeus&amp;k=United+States&amp;k=US+politics&amp;k=Washington+Post&amp;k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\"> &lt;a href=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; alt=&quot;Ads by The Guardian&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </iframe> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401403471|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|f5b65dff047a48091993fd158637c8bf999ab767 -->',\n",

On this front, liquidity from the ECB and the potential activation of its bond buying programme, the OMT, will help soothe fears in the first half of the year at least.</p> <p>However, politics will be the name of the game.

On the other, classrooms may have to close because Greek schools can\\'t afford to heat them ...</p> <h2>Here\\'s the good news</h2> <p>In what could be the single biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) ever in Greece, the Swiss-based Trans Adriatic Pipeline company announced that it has officially initiated the process to begin \\u201chost agreement\\u201d talks with the Greek government. The joint venture is competing to deliver gas from the Caspian region to Europe. If selected, Greece would become part of the fourth major gas import corridor for the EU, with the pipeline going through Greece, Albania and under the Adriatic to Italy, TAP officials say. The final selection of the gas transportation route is expected early in 2013. Azerbaijan\\u2019s BP-operated Shah Deniz consortium will oversee the process in a deal that would be worth \\u20ac1.5bn for the crisis-hit country. TAP is the only option that will go through Greece.</p> <p>&quot;The host government agreement [governing the group\\u2019s investment] is a key step towards securing selection in 2013 of the Greek route,&quot; TAP\\'s country manager for Greece, Rikard Scoufias, said. &quot;We are very pleased with our co-operation with the Greek government, and this is yet another significant step towards realising the TAP project, which is destined to bring thousands of direct and indirect job opportunities as well as strengthen Greece\\'s strategic role in Europe.&quot;</p> <h2>Now for the bad news:</h2> <p>In another area of the energy sector, Greeks are in for a rough ride, with the&nbsp;nation reeling from the announcement that state-run schools in snow-hit central and northern Greece may have to cancel classes because of a lack of funds to heat them.</p> <p>Under pressure to meet internationally mandated budget targets, the Greek government has slashed funding for school heating oil supplies by around 60% as part of cost-cutting that has seen operational school expenses drop from \\u20ac110m in 2011 to \\u20ac80m this year.&nbsp;Just as the country is about to be gripped by a cold snap it has emerged that many schools have yet to receive any funding for heating at all. With temperatures due to drop to well below freezing, the primary school teachers\\u2019 federation (DOE) said the union may soon \\u201chave to suspend classes because of the cold weather\\u201d. \\u201cMany schools are facing serious problems with heating oil supplies,\\u201d DOE said in a statement.</p> <p>Regular readers will know that sky-high oil prices in Greece are a classic case of big monopolies hogging the market.

Both companies are owned by two of the wealthiest tycoons in Greece, which is also hobbled by the highest fuel taxes on the continent of Europe.</p> <p>An internal report produced by the International Monetary Fund, part of the troika of creditors propping up the insolvent Greek economy, this year attributed uncompetitive markets to the high costs. \\u201cThe Greek market is highly concentrated and basically controlled by two domestic refiners,\\u201d the report contended, adding that lower fuel prices could help bring down the country\\u2019s consumer inflation rate by more than 1%.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T12:23:25.467Z\">at 12.23pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50d2f54895cb94a7be21b23b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T11:23:52.146Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank is also musing on the issue of how democracy survives within the eurozone:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/status/281719632434438146\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Have we reached an inflection point in the extent to which democracy &amp; accountability as we understand them r incompatible with crisis mgt?</p>\\u2014 Sony Kapoor (@SonyKapoor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/status/281719632434438146\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-20T11:16:09+00:00\">December 20, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>Answers below (or <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/@SonyKapoor%20\">here</a>)</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-50d2f2e595cb94a7be21b236\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T11:13:41.644Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RencapMan\">Charles Robertson</a> of <a href=\"http://www.rencap.com/\">Renaissance Capital</a> believes Stournaras is absolutely right to caution that Greece\\'s political system could struggle to handle public opposition to its austerity plans.</p> <p>The Greek finance minister\\'s comments (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/20/eurozone-crisis-greece-finance-minister-warning#block-50d2c7e795cb94a7be21b20b\">see opening post</a>) echo Robertson\\'s own concerns about Europes austerity programmes \\u2013 that people won\\'t tolerate them.</p> <p>He argues that Greece <strong>will</strong> leave the eurozone next year, with Spain following in 2014:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I<strong>s an economic policy that has produced 25% unemployment in Spain and Greece, and is forecast to make this worse, a morally acceptable policy choice? </strong></p> <p>How does an electorate react to such a socially damaging manmade disaster?

That means he could then be appointed to the government after the vote.</p> <p>Either way, Monti is still expected to reveal his plans over the weekend.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T10:54:58.182Z\">at 10.54am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50d2d96795cb94a7be21b212\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T09:24:55.824Z\">9.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Downbeat economic news from Italy \\u2013 retail sales fell by 1.0% in October compared with September, the steepest monthly fall since April.</p> <p>That means sales were 3.8% lower than a year ago, showing the impact of the Italian recession.</p> <p>Italian inflation is running at 2.8%, so the belt-tightening is more severe in real terms.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T09:47:55.407Z\">at 9.47am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50d2d2f295cb94a7be21b20f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T08:57:22.979Z\">8.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T08:58:56.899Z\">at 8.58am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50d2d07e95cb94a7be21b20e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-20T08:46:54.328Z\">8.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Yannis Stournaras</strong>\\'s warning may have taken some of the shine off the recent rally in Greek bonds.

After two of President Richard Nixon\\'s attorney generals had refused to obey a presidential order to dismiss <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/may/31/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Archibald Cox</a>, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate Nixon\\'s conduct in the Watergate affair, in the so-called \"Saturday Night Massacre\", Bork \\u2013 third in seniority in the justice department as solicitor general \\u2013 carried out the deed.</p><p>Even more contentious was the acrimonious hearing before the judiciary committee of the Senate in 1987 after President <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/jun/07/guardianobituaries.past\" title=\"\">Ronald Reagan</a> nominated Bork for a vacant seat on the supreme court. Liberal groups, led by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/26/obituary-ted-kennedy\" title=\"\">Senator Edward Kennedy</a>, attacked Bork so fiercely that a new noun, \"borking\", was coined to described fierce attempts to destroy the reputation of a man nominated for public office.</p><p>As a scholar, Bork, who taught law at Yale, was an \"originalist\". He believed, that is, that activist liberal judges had departed both from their proper role and from the constitution. Instead they should determine the original intention of the 18th-century framers of the constitution. Bork wrote books with titles such as Slouching Towards Gomorrah, in which he denounced what he saw as liberal departures from the path of constitutional righteousness.</p><p>As an ideological activist, Bork was a key figure in the creation of the intellectual armature of the \"conservative ascendancy\". He was one of the founders of the Federalist Society, a membership organisation that recruited young conservative lawyers so that there should always be a supply of conservatives to interpret the law from the bench. He was associated with many of the conservative organisations seeking to overthrow liberal influences in the law schools, the government and the courts. He was associated with the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative thinktank, and was funded by the rightwing John M Olin foundation.</p><p>A man of great erudition and with a sardonic sense of humour, Bork had a notably pugnacious style. He was deeply embittered by his treatment by the media over the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" and even more by the experience of being denied a supreme court seat, as he saw it, unjustly. Witty and congenial within the conservative confraternity, he was surly and suspicious with the media and hostile if he sniffed the presence of liberals.</p><p>Although he had long denounced the compensation culture in American tort law, he sued the Yale club for $1m when he tripped and fell on his way to the platform to give a speech. When George W Bush nominated his own lawyer, Harriet Miers, to the supreme court, Bork called it a \"disaster\" and \"a slap in the face to the conservatives who\\'ve been building up a conservative legal movement for the last 20 years\". In effect, he borked her.</p><p>Bork was born in Pittsburgh. His father was a steel purchasing agent, prosperous enough to send him to the expensive boarding school <a href=\"http://www.hotchkiss.org/\" title=\"\">Hotchkiss</a>, in Connecticut. He served in the US marines in China in 1945 and graduated from the University of Chicago in two years. He never forgave the <a href=\"http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/\" title=\"\">Columbia School of Journalism </a>for refusing to admit him until he had undergone the full four-year undergraduate course.</p><p>In revenge, as he once put it, he became a lawyer. He studied at the law school of the University of Chicago, where he came into contact with conservative teachers such as Edward Levi and with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/nov/17/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">Milton Friedman</a>\\'s brother-in-law, Aaron Director.</p><p>He practised law for eight years with a big Chicago law firm,<a href=\"http://www.kirkland.com/\" title=\"\"> Kirkland &amp; Ellis</a>, then taught law at Yale, where both Bill and Hillary Clinton were among his students, or rather, as he put it, were in the room when he was teaching. As early as the 1964 election he found himself almost alone among 2,000 Yale professors in backing the Republican Barry Goldwater against Lyndon Johnson for president.</p><p>Bork\\'s first speciality was anti-trust law. He argued that trusts might often be advantageous for consumers. Later he turned his attention to constitutional law. He was much influenced by Alexander Bickel, who believed liberal judges had gone too far in using the law to impose political beliefs.</p><p>Bork was invited to advise the White House after Nixon\\'s vice-president, Spiro Agnew, was caught taking bribes. He impressed Nixon, who appointed him solicitor general, and Bork served Nixon loyally by firing Cox. He believed Nixon had the right to dismiss Cox, but initially thought he ought to resign to avoid being seen as Nixon\\'s henchman. However, he was persuaded to stay on as acting attorney general until William Saxbe was appointed, and as solicitor general until 1977.</p><p>He returned to teach at Yale, but in 1982 he was appointed to the US court of appeals. When in 1987 he was nominated to the supreme court, liberals were outraged. \"Robert Bork\\'s America,\" Ted Kennedy said, \"is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, [and] schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution ... No justice would be better than this injustice.\"</p><p>Civil rights, civil liberties and abortion rights organisations all denounced Bork and although he complained that their criticisms were \"scurrilous\", Reagan withdrew the nomination.</p><p>Bork\\'s first wife, Claire Davidson, whom he married in 1952, died of cancer in 1980. In 1982 he married Mary Ellen Pohl, a former nun, and in 2003 Bork converted to Catholicism. His daughter, Ellen, is the deputy director of the neo-conservative Project for a New American Century. He is also survived by a son, Robert H Bork Jr.</p><p><em>\\u2022 </em>Robert Heron Bork, lawyer and polemicist, born 1 March 1927; died 19 December 2012</p><p>\\u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2012.

She later thanked her staff before making a brief appearance in front of crowds in central Seoul. Her victory, she said, was a sign that the country\\'s economy would recover.</p><p>Moon, a leftwing former human rights lawyer from the Democratic United party, conceded defeat and congratulated Park on her victory.</p><p>Park, 60, had to overcome resentment towards her privileged background and accusations that her Saenuri party was too close to the powerful chaebol conglomerates that dominate the South Korean economy. While her gender was a frequent talking point among pundits, it did not appear to have been a major influence on voters.</p><p>The election has captivated South Koreans, who turned out to vote in huge numbers despite below-freezing conditions. The country\\'s election commission put turnout at 75.8%, the highest in 15 years. Moon, who appealed more to younger voters, had stated that he needed a turnout of 77%to stand a chance of making it to the presidential Blue House.</p><p>Many voters were divided over Park\\'s suitability to tackle mounting economic problems, improve welfare for a rapidly aging population and improve relations with North Korea after five years of deteriorating cross-border ties under the current hardline president, Lee Myung-bak.</p><p>The legacy of her father, Park Chung-hee, continued to divide the country 33 years after his death. Older, conservative voters credit him with promoting rapid industrialisation and laying the foundations for the powerful economy of today. Others, though, have never forgotten his ruthless crackdowns against opponents, some of whom were tortured or executed, and blame him for delaying the arrival of democracy.</p><p>Moon, 59, was among the democracy activists imprisoned during Park\\'s rule, which ended in 1979 when he was assassinated by his intelligence chief. Five years earlier, Park Geun-hye, then aged just 22, had been forced into the role of first lady after her mother, Yuk Young-soo, was killed by a North Korean assassin\\'s bullet intended for her husband.</p><p>Fond memories of her mother, South Korea\\'s most popular first lady, and a belief that she had inherited her father\\'s determined streak, may have given Park the vital few votes that secured her victory.</p><p>\"Park is good-hearted, calm and trustworthy,\" said Lee Hye-young, a 50-year-old housewife from Seoul. \"And I think she would handle North Korea better. Moon would want to make too many concessions to North Korea.\"</p><p>Park Hye-sook, a 67-year-old resident of the capital, said she trusted Park. \"She will save our country. Her father rescued the country.\"</p><p>North Korea did not become a major issue in the election until last week, when it successfully launched a rocket and sent a satellite into orbit.</p><p>Both candidates said they would seek greater engagement with the North, although Park may have benefited from her demand that the regime abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p><p>Park, who said she had never married or had children so she could devote her life to public service, will inherit a formidable array of economic problems when she takes office on 25 February.</p><p>Inequality and youth unemployment have increased under Lee, who by law cannot seek a second term, and the economy is forecast to grow this year at its slowest pace since 2009.</p><p>\\u2022\\xa0This article was amended on 21 December 2012 because the original called Park Hye-sook a \"president of the capital\".

But he doesn\\'t want to talk specific numbers.</p><p>Nor is he terribly keen to speculate on the causes of the sudden demand. But he acknowledges that it probably has everything to do with a man killing two people with an assault rifle last week in a Portland shopping mall less than 10 minutes drive away, and Friday\\'s massacre of 20 small children and seven adults on the other side of the country in Connecticut.</p><p>\"Handgun sales are up substantially and modern sporting rifles are up astronomically,\" he said after a few days when his shop, Northwest Armory, was packed with buyers sizing up the most popular pistol in the US, the Glock, and the military-style AR-15 assault rifle, which also comes with a pink stock for women. \"The people you see are twofold. There are first-time buyers who are in fear of what the future will bring. But most of what you saw is people hedging their bets that there might be a political policy put forward by the liberal side of the government.\"</p><p>Durkheimer means his shoppers fear that the shock of the Newtown, Connecticut, killings might cause the public and Congress to support a reinstatement of the ban on some of his most popular lines.</p><p>That\\'s a picture replicated across the US from <a href=\"http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Gun-Sales-Up-After-CT-Shooting-San-Diego-Control-Restrictions--183793111.html\">California</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/Gun-sales-increase-after-Connecticut-massacre/-/9853400/17798768/-/10ekpssz/-/index.html?absolute=true\">Louisiana</a>, and even in Newtown where Robert Caselnova said his gun shop saw high demand for assault rifles in the days after the killings. The nationwide increase in sales was reflected in longer than usual delays for legally required background checks which in some cases took hours rather than minutes.</p><p>The surge in sales is not unusual. Following a mass killing at a Colorado cinema in July, applications to buy guns rose more than 40% in a week. The murder two years ago of six people during an assassination attempt against congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was badly wounded, prompted a 60% increase in gun sales in a single day in Arizona.</p><p>The increase in weapons sales also comes in a year in which the FBI reported a record number of background checks for gun purchases, with nearly 17m applications.</p><p>Durkheimer has seen that reflected in his own sales which have been rising all of this year. Last month, with Barack Obama\\'s re-election, they were more than double those of December 2011.</p><p>\"No question, an election year where Democrats are winning drives a lot of business,\" he said.</p><p>Particularly when it\\'s a Democrat like Obama who many conservatives regard as somehow un-American and fear he is after their guns even though his four years in power have seen only a loosening of firearms regulations.</p><p>But Durkheimer, who counts elephant hunting in Africa among his pastimes, has not seen anything like the past weekend.</p><p>\"There are two kinds of Americans. People who want to take care of themselves and those who want to be taken care of. The ones who want to take care of themselves are the ones who come into my shop,\" he said.</p><p>The buyers regard the Newtown killings as a tragedy, but view any connection to their right to own weapons as a political ploy aimed at depriving them of their guns.</p><p>\"It\\'s terrible what happened. It\\'s just plain evil,\" said Richard Merritt on the steps of the gun shop after browsing assault rifles with a thought to buying himself one for Christmas to supplement the handguns and hunting rifle he owns.</p><p>\"But there\\'s people trying to use that to say I\\'m responsible because I own a gun. Where\\'s the connection? The only people making one are doing it for political ends because there\\'s not one of these massacres would ever have been stopped by a law that takes my gun away. But now they\\'re talking about doing that again, I think this may be the time to buy.\"</p><p>Durkheimer is sick of gun owners being painted as the problem. Like many, he feels demonised and vilified for the crimes of a few because he enjoys hunting and shooting ranges. That puts him on the defensive when groups campaigning for tightened gun regulation might be better off trying to win him over with assurances that their calls to restrict the sale of assault rifles and magazines that hold large numbers of bullets won\\'t end with the confiscation of handguns and hunting rifles.</p><p>\"It\\'s just another thing that will drive a wedge between us. Instead of the United States being a melting pot it\\'s more polarised,\" he said.</p><p>It\\'s a common claim among gun owners that states with the greatest restrictions on weapons are facing rising crime while gun crime is falling in those with the loosest laws, such as permitting the carrying of concealed weapons. A study by the Center to Prevent Gun Violence in California found the opposite to be true: that seven of 10 states with the strongest gun laws, including Connecticut, are among those with the lowest rates of deaths from guns.</p><p>Then there\\'s the conventional wisdom among gun owners that if only someone at any of the recent massacres had been armed, they could have put a stop to it. That was the position of Gun Owners of America, which said that if teachers at the Newtown school had been armed, the killer could have been stopped.</p><p>Its director, Larry Pratt, went so far as to say: \"Gun control supporters have the blood of little children on their hands\".</p><p>But just down the road from Durkheimer\\'s shop, at least one person carrying a gun during the shooting at a shopping mall last week decided not to fire it at the man who murdered two people before shooting himself. Nick Meli told the Oregonian that he trained his weapon on the killer, Jacob Tyler Roberts, but didn\\'t shoot because <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2012/12/security_guard_said_he_had_rob.html#incart_river_default\">he was worried about hitting an innocent bystander</a>.</p><p>There is one area of common ground for Durkheimer. Demands by some political leaders for greater gun control have been accompanied by calls for increased scrutiny of the all too common role mental illness plays in massacres, and what that means both for better treatment and for weapons sales. Although that\\'s not exactly how Durkheimer sees it.</p><p>\"The black and white is the guy in Connecticut\\'s a very sick person. What kind of a person will do harm to his mother?\" he said. \"I believe this problem, this tragic event in Connecticut, shows we have a huge mental health and social services problem. The do-gooders in society think it\\'s unfair to institutionalise people so we\\'re going to make a concerted effort to integrate them into society. And then they are loose.\"</p><p>Does he sell guns to those who appear to be mentally unstable? \"I definitely have seen people come in and say some things,\" he said, trailing off. \"But I believe firmly it\\'s not my place to be judge, jury, God on who has a gun.\"</p><p>Durkheimer is confident that calls for greater control won\\'t go anywhere at a national level. For many gun owners, he says, it is a voting issue.</p><p>\"When Bill Clinton introduced the assault weapons ban, it cost the Democrats a hundred seats in Congress. Since then, you haven\\'t heard anything about gun control until this shooting. The Democrats have been quiet. I guarantee you, behind closed doors elected Democrats are saying: I don\\'t want to talk about guns,\" he said.</p><p>\"Hypothetically we could have some kind of presidential executive order. But I don\\'t believe there\\'ll be any kind of vote between the Senate and the House of Representatives. I think there could be some states that pass laws. Oregon could be one of them. There are a lot of displaced Californians here who have left their state going to the potheads and down the toilet, and now they want to do the same here.\"</p><p>But he wryly notes that the Taliban have kept the American army busy for a decade precisely because Afghanistan has a long standing culture of every man having a gun.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+gun+control&k=United+States&k=US+politics&k=Obama+administration&k=Newtown+shooting&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401279678|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|d560f66588bd9367bbb0b615b87a06321a359b05 -->',\n",

Inouye had represented Hawaii in Congress since 1959, from the moment the former territory achieved statehood.</p><p>A trailblazer, he was the first Japanese American to serve in the Senate and, despite working quietly and keeping a low profile throughout most of his career, caught the public eye for his steely determination during investigations into two major government scandals. At the Watergate hearings in 1973, his aside about President Richard Nixon\\'s aide John Ehrlichman \\u2013 \"What a liar\" \\u2013 was famously caught by a microphone he had believed to be off. Ehrlichman\\'s lawyer, John Wilson, later called Inouye a \"little Jap\", prompting a groundswell of support for the Senator.</p><p>He seemed the personification of a quest for simple truth when in 1987 he chaired the hearings on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/jun/07/guardianobituaries.past\" title=\"\">Ronald Reagan</a>\\'s Iran-Contra scandal, in heated exchanges with the lawyer for Reagan\\'s aide Oliver North, who had testified that military secrets were not safe with Congress. Inouye, a decorated second world war hero who had lost an arm fighting in Europe, called it \"painful\" to listen to North, who had arrived bedecked with ribbons on his dress uniform.</p><p>Inouye was born in Honululu, a \"Nisei\" (second generation Japanese American), whose father had been born in Japan, as had his mother\\'s parents. After graduating from McKinley high school, Honululu, he was studying medicine at the University of Hawaii when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and he served as a medical volunteer helping deal with the casualties. He left his studies to join the US army as soon as the ban on Japanese Americans enlisting was lifted. Although there was no internment in Hawaii, Inouye was later asked why he had volunteered, when Japanese on the mainland were being held in camps, and he answered simply: \"I did it for my children.\"</p><p>He served with the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team (composed mostly of Japanese Americans), winning promotion to sergeant and then a field commission as a lieutenant. In the \"Lost Battalion\" battle in the Vosges mountains, France, he was hit by a bullet which was stopped by two silver dollars he carried in his pocket. But he had lost his lucky charms just before an assault on Colle Musatello, in the Po Valley, Italy, in April 1945. Despite being wounded, he took out the first of three German machine-gun positions pinning down his platoon. He led an attack on the second, before collapsing. Then, as his unit attacked the third, he crawled into position to throw a grenade. As he stood to throw, a German rifle grenade severed his arm, leaving the grenade in the fist. Keeping his troops at a distance, he prised the grenade out, threw it, and finished the attack one-handed. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.</p><p>The 442nd was thought to be the most decorated regiment in the US army, but racial prejudices often influenced the awarding of the Congressional Medal of Honor. In 2000, after years of campaigning by others, Inouye and 21 other Nisei veterans were presented with the nation\\'s highest military award in a special ceremony by President Bill Clinton.</p><p>After the war, Inouye returned to college, but switched his studies to political science. He graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1950, and took his law degree from George Washington University in 1953. He then served in Hawaii\\'s territorial house and senate before winning election, in 1959, as the first Congressman from the new 50th state. He was re-elected in 1960, and elected to the Senate in 1962. In 2010 he won re-election to his ninth Senate term with 75% of the vote.</p><p>In 1968, when he delivered the keynote speech at the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, Inouye was being considered as Hubert Humphrey\\'s vice-presidential candidate. Lyndon Johnson felt Inouye would help defuse the issue of the Vietnam war, telling Humphrey: \"He answers Vietnam with that empty sleeve.\" But Inouye declined to run.</p><p>Although his profile was highest on those investigative committees, Inouye\\'s chairmanship of a number of standing committees highlighted his ability to get things done quietly, as his integrity and honesty were recognised on both sides of the Senate aisle. He headed committees on intelligence and <a href=\"http://www.indian.senate.gov/\" title=\"\">Indian affairs</a>. He became an honorary member of the Navajo nation, given the name \"the Leader Who Has Returned With a Plan\". He also chaired the commerce committee and, latterly, the powerful appropriations committee.</p><p>Inouye\\'s first wife, Maggie, predeceased him in 2006. He is survived by his second wife, Irene, and by his son, Kenny, a musician. When asked how he would like to be remembered, Inouye said: \"I represented the people of Hawaii and this nation honestly and to the best of my ability. I think I did OK.\"</p><p><em>\\u2022 </em>Daniel Ken Inouye, politician, born 7 September 1924; died 17 December 2012</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=United+States&k=US+Senate&k=US+politics&k=US+Congress&k=Hawaii&k=Watergate\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401278929|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|f0c4fbd28696bfcfd4fe0c438d2c4271ce0eddd2 -->',\n",

If 2011 was dominated by events unfolding in Athens, the agenda of almost every international gathering in 2012 focused on how Madrid would extricate itself from the debt trap that had already claimed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland\" title=\"\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/portugal\" title=\"\">Portugal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/greece\" title=\"\">Greece</a>.</p><p>Spain\\'s right-of-centre prime minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mariano-rajoy\" title=\"\">Mariano Rajoy</a> inherited a policy of denial from his socialist predecessors and, initially at least, adopted the same tactic. But with Spain targeted by international investors as the next domino after Greece to jeopardise the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis\" title=\"\">euro currency project</a>, it became the focus of worldwide attention.</p><p>If only Europe could resolve its debt problems, the global economy would recover its momentum. This was the message from Tokyo, Beijing and Washington, where policymakers felt constrained in the face of Europe\\'s procrastination. An impending recession in the eurozone made reforms all the more urgent.</p><p>A strongly growing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\" title=\"\">US economy</a> at the end of 2011 entered a presidential election year with Europe on its back. Thankfully for President <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a>, the housing crisis, which had seen prices fall by more than 40% in states such as Nevada and Arizona, bottomed out, small companies began hiring and bank lending eased in time for the November vote.</p><p>Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan\" title=\"\">Japan</a> began the year in recovery mode. It suffered the double hit of a financial crisis and a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\" title=\"\">tsunami</a>, which wrecked much of the country\\'s north-east in the spring of 2011. Regaining export orders was the No 1 priority and all seemed to be going well until the summer, when the balance of payments went into reverse, largely as a result of huge gas imports to replace the lack of nuclear power following the Fukushima tragedy. Worse, major electronics firms Sony, Panasonic and Sharp revealed deep losses. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea\" title=\"\">South Korean</a> manufacturing revolution, led by Samsung, had effectively ended 30 years of Japanese dominance. Car manufacture continued to be one of the bright spots, though a dispute over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea put even that in jeopardy.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\" title=\"\">China</a>, which claims the islands along with Japan, allowed nationalists to riot largely unchecked, burning and looting Japanese shops and factories. A boycott of Japanese goods resulted in a slump in sales of Toyotas and Nissans, again allowing the South Koreans a competitive advantage.</p><p>Part of the problem followed a year-long slowdown in Chinese manufacturing that was already causing jitters across the west. The Chinese powerhouse economy had survived the global financial crisis after a large injection of government funds, but Beijing had little room to repeat the exercise without stoking inflation and an already rampant property bubble.</p><p>Tentative moves to increase government spending on health, social security and pensions, alongside liberalising laws designed to allow more private-sector involvement in areas previously dominated by the state, helped the economy move forward. Yet a political stasis, ahead of November\\'s appointment of a successor to premier Wen Jiabao, appeared to hold up progress.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/brazil\" title=\"\">Brazil</a>, which saw its income jump above Britain\\'s in late 2011 to make it the world\\'s sixth-largest economy, suffered a sharp slowdown following a surge in the value of its currency.</p><p>Like the other Bric countries of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\" title=\"\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india\" title=\"\">India</a> and China, Brazil found it was more dependent on Europe and the west than its public statements of economic independence gave credit.</p><p>It complained about the volume of money printed by western central banks that was making its own more attractive. With hot money pouring in, Brazil\\'s central bank raised capital controls. Unfortunately the policy had little effect; foreign investment funds continued to pour in and Brazilian exports became more expensive.</p><p>Only <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa/roundup\" title=\"\">Africa</a> appeared immune to the knock-on effects of the eurozone debt crisis. From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\" title=\"\">Nigeria</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/zambia\" title=\"\">Zambia</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica\" title=\"\">South Africa</a>, growth rates topped  5% compared with less than 2% in the US and sub-zero in most major European countries by the end of  the year.</p><p>However, a meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank\" title=\"\">World Bank</a> in Tokyo in October revealed widespread disquiet among African trade unions and charities at the distribution of incomes and wealth. World Bank officials were bombarded with stories of poverty among workers while owners, many of them foreign mining companies, made millions of dollars in profits.</p><p>In Europe, the year ended on a low note. While Spain appeared to get a grip on its bankrupt banking sector and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/european-central-bank\" title=\"\">European Central Bank</a> pencilled in a recovery for 2013 across the continent, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy\" title=\"\">Italy</a> appeared to want the limelight. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a> burst back on to the political scene, potentially stealing the lead role in the debt crisis from Madrid.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/theguardian&k=Financial+crisis&k=World+news&k=Economics&k=Banking&k=Financial+sector&k=Business\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/theguardian/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/theguardian/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401013003|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|6bebaa365d51c9092393baf71ae936d18125b8b6 -->',\n",

Support for greater restrictions attracts the opposition of the powerful pro-gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, without winning many votes.</p><p>After the horror of Newtown, the issue is back on the agenda with more powerful voices calling for reform, from New York\\'s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, to leading senators. Among them is Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and NRA member, who said on Monday it was time to &quot;move beyond rhetoric&quot; and discuss new gun controls.</p><p>&quot;I don\\'t know anyone in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle,&quot; he said on MSNBC. &quot;I don\\'t know anyone that needs 30 rounds in a clip to go hunting. I mean, these are things that need to be talked about.&quot;</p><p>The question for Barack Obama is whether the rest of Congress agrees.</p><p>The president\\'s appeal at the memorial service for the Newtown victims for an end to the &quot;carnage&quot; and suggestion that he is finally willing to press for further controls on guns is mobilising activists, who believe that the brutal deaths of 20 small children has shocked the nation sufficiently to embrace change.</p><p>The immediate push is for a renewal of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which barred the manufacture and import of an array semi-automatic weapons and high capacity bullet magazines.</p><p>Semi-automatics fitted with large magazines have been a feature of most recent massacres in the US, including in Newtown.</p><p>The law expired in 2004 amid strong resistance from the gun lobby, which said it had no discernible impact on crime levels. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, named after the White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan in 1981, countered that the ban led to a significant drop in the number of such guns used in crime, although they were always only a fraction of the total.</p><p>But crime statistics aside, an attempt to renew the ban is likely to face entrenched resistance from the NRA and many gun owners that could scare off congressional support.</p><p>After Congress passed the original restrictions on semi-automatics in 1994, Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives for the first time in nearly 40 years. The issue helped mobilise the gun lobby, as opposition coalesced around the idea that the ban was the first step toward taking away guns from Americans.</p><p>An NRA campaign helped oust members of Congress who supported the ban, including the Democratic speaker, Tom Foley. Clinton acknowledged in his autobiography that his gun control legislation damaged the Democrats at the ballot box.</p><p>&quot;The NRA had a great night. They beat both Speaker Tom Foley and Jack Brooks, two of the ablest members of Congress, who had warned me this would happen. Foley was the first speaker to be defeated in more than a century,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The gun lobby claimed to have defeated 19 of the 24 members on its hit list. They did at least that much damage and could rightly claim to have made Gingrich the House speaker.&quot;</p><p>That has left political scars. When the ban on semi-automatics came up for a renewal a decade later, many politicians concluded there was little to be gained and a lot to lose in crossing the NRA. The renewal was blocked in the Senate.</p><p>Since then, a Congresswoman from New York, Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was among six people shot dead by a gunman on a train in 1993, has repeatedly introduced bills to renew the ban. None of them made it out of committee.</p><p>Step forward to 2012, and the NRA is regarded as intimidating as ever. <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">The Sunlight Foundation explained the reason</a> in one graph \\u2013 it spent almost $25m in the 2012 election cycle, 66 times more than the Brady campaign. </p><p>But the actual power of the NRA is open to dispute, and the presidential election data supports the theory that it is not as terrifying as it appears. The NRA, through its Political Victory Fund, spent almost $12m in a failed attempt to stop Obama\\'s re-election, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/committee/national-rifle-association-of-america-political-victory-fund/C00053553\">according to Sunlight</a>, which also found that across all the races the fund invested in, the NRA enjoyed a return rate of just 0.83%.</p><p>Some members of Congress have suggested the pro-gun lobby is able to mobilise far fewer votes than it claims, and that its influence lies in its ability to intimidate, not least by threatening to throw millions into congressional races to support or oppose individual candidates.</p><p>&quot;I believe the NRA has as much sway on Capitol Hill as any lobbying group in the country,&quot; Mike Castle, a former Republican congressman, told National Public Radio. &quot;They\\'ve done a very effective job of convincing people that, whether it\\'s true or not \\u2026 they have the power to completely limit their futures in elected office if they don\\'t co-operate.&quot;</p><p>Few dispute, though, that however the NRA exercises its influence, it is considerable. If renewing the entire assault weapons ban proves too hard, gun control advocates may have more luck in reintroducing restrictions on the size of magazines. Under the 1994 law, new magazines could not hold more than 10 bullets. That restriction fell away a decade later.</p><p>James Holmes, who murdered 12 people at a Colorado cinema in July, used a drum magazine capable of holding about 100 bullets which could all be fired in less than two minutes.</p><p>Pressure is also building for tighter background checks on gun owners, particularly to weed out those with a history of mental illness. Some gun control advocates say the Obama administration does not enforce existing requirements vigorously enough. But even with better checks there is an enormous loophole \\u2013 gun shows.</p><p>Private sellers at America\\'s ubiquitous gun shows can sell any weapon to anyone without even asking for identification. Buying a semi-automatic at a gun show is as easy as picking up a loaf of bread in a supermarket.</p><p>Bloomberg has been pressing for years for a change in the law. Last year he released a video recorded at a gun show at which an undercover investigator was sold a gun even though he told the seller he could not possibly pass a federal background check.</p><p>Bloomberg said that many of those who describe themselves as private sellers at gun shows are in fact professional weapons dealers looking to get around the requirement to make background checks on buyers.</p><p>&quot;We have demonstrated how easy it is for anyone to buy a semi-automatic handgun and a high-capacity magazine, no questions asked,&quot; said Bloomberg.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\"> <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&amp;partner=guardianapis.com/world&amp;k=US+gun+control&amp;k=Newtown+shooting&amp;k=Connecticut&amp;k=United+States&amp;k=World+news&amp;k=US+Congress\" style=\"border: none\"> &lt;a href=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom&quot; alt=&quot;Ads by The Guardian&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; </iframe> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401233139|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|ea8a831385d3080e94d3b0fae9fd8088a82f1428 -->',\n",

No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society, but that can\\'t be an excuse for inaction. Surely we can do better than this.</p> <p>If there\\'s even one step we can take to save another child or another parent or another town from the grief that\\'s visited Tucson and Aurora and Oak Creek and Newtown and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that, then surely we have an obligation to try.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, I\\'ll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens, from law enforcement, to mental health professionals, to parents and educators, in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice do we have?

And that\\'s his job.\\'</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Because it\\'s worth reading in full, here\\'s some of New York City mayor <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong>\\'s comments today on Meet The Press \\u2013 and his argument that President Obama needs to lead the charge for greater gun regulation:</em></p> <p><strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong>: It\\'s so unbelievable. And it only happens in America. And it happens again and again. There was another shooting yesterday. Three people killed I think in a hospital. We kill people in schools. We kill them in hospitals. We kill them in religious organizations. We kill them when they\\'re young. We kill them when they\\'re old. And we\\'ve just got to stop this.</p> <p><strong>David Gregory</strong>: A significant statement as far as it goes. You\\'re calling for immediate action. What precisely?</p> <p><strong>Bloomberg</strong>: Well, number one, I think the President should console the country. But he\\'s the Commander-in-chief as well as the Consoler-in-chief. And he calls for action, but he called for action two years ago. And every time there is a disaster like this, a tragedy like this, everybody says, well, now is not the time. Or if you had fixed the problem, you can\\'t guarantee that this particular event would have been prevented.</p> <p>All of that is true. It\\'s time for the President, I think, to stand up and lead. And tell this country what we should do. Not go to Congress and say what you guys want to do. This should be his number one agenda. He is the President of the United States. And if he does nothing during his second term, something like 48,000 Americans will be killed with illegal guns. That is roughly the number of Americans killed in the whole of the Vietnam War.</p> <p><strong>Gregory</strong>: So what do you do?</p> <p><strong>Bloomberg</strong>: Well, there\\'s a number of things that the President can do and a number of things that Congress can do. And there are a number of things that you and I can do as voters. What the President can do is number one through executive action, he can order his agencies to enforce the laws more aggressively. I think there\\'s something like 77,000 people who have been accused of lying when they have applied for a gun permit. We\\'ve only prosecuted 77 of them.</p> <p>The President can introduce legislation even if it doesn\\'t get passed. The President campaigned back in 2008 on a bill that would prohibit assault weapons. We\\'ve got to really question whether military style weapons with big magazines belong in the streets of America in this day and age. Nobody questions the Second Amendment\\'s right to bear arms. But I don\\'t think the founding fathers had the idea that every man, woman, and child could carry an assault weapon.</p> <p>And I think the President through his leadership could get a bill like that through Congress. But at least he\\'s got to try. And that\\'s his job.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-16T18:24:18.899Z\">at 1.24pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50ce0ee6b5791bfc0f461201\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-16T18:11:50.858Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Associated Press reports from Newtown:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Worshippers hurriedly left a church Sunday, saying they were told there was a bomb threat not far from the elementary school where 20 kids and six adults were massacred.</p> <p>At least a dozen police in camouflage Swat gear and carrying guns arrived at the St Rose of Lima Church.

Wrong.</p> <p>Shooters pistol range in New Milford, which is about 15 miles from Newtown where the rampage took place, is very much open for business this morning. I\\u2019m here now, sitting in my car outside the warehouse that contains the range, and I can hear the \\u201cpop, pop\\u201d of guns firing about every 10 seconds.</p> <p>The reason I\\u2019m sitting outside the range is that when I went inside to see the manager of Shooters, he refused to talk to me, other than to confirm that the facility is open today. He was sitting at a counter inside the warehouse which also acts as a gun shop; at his back was a row of guns, including semi-automatic assault rifles similar to the Bushmaster used by Lanza, that stretches for about 30 feet.</p> <p>The website for Shooters says that \\u201ctarget shooting is fun and challenging for everyone\\u201d, but adds: \\u201cSafety is our first priority\\u201d. It says of its shop that it also offers rental guns: \\u201cwe offer several selections of revolvers and semi-automatics from .22 to .45 caliber.\\u201d</p> <p>Outside the range, I\\u2019ve just spoken to one customer who has arrived to go target shooting with his 14-year-old son. Mike D\\u2019Amico says the two come to shoot because \\u201cWe enjoy it. We just enjoy shooting - it\\u2019s something we like to do, it\\u2019s personal enjoyment.\\u201d</p> <p>When I ask D\\u2019Amico what he thinks about the debate around gun control that has started up in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy, and President Obama\\u2019s call for \\u201cmeaningful action\\u201d on gun control, I\\u2019m surprised by his answer. He\\u2019s in favour of greater gun controls, he says.</p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve thought about it for quite a while. I just don\\u2019t see the need for people to carry some of these big guns - they don\\u2019t seem appropriate for target practice or shooting and hunting. Some of the weapons available are just not right.\\u201d</p> <p>That\\u2019s the thing about America and guns - it never ceases to surprise. A shooting range is open two days after one of the most horrendous acts of gun violence the country has suffered, and it happened just a short ride away. But when you ask a man preparing to go shooting with his teenaged son, he\\u2019s says he\\u2019s all in favour of greater gun control.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-16T16:08:07.300Z\">at 11.08am ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50cdedb7b5791bfc0f4611e9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-16T15:50:15.522Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>The Guardian\\'s Adam Gabbatt is in Newtown, where church services are taking place this morning:</em></p> <p>Members of the clergy handed out a box of tissues to each pew ahead of the service at Trinity Episcopal Church in Newtown.</p> <p>The large grey stone church is around a mile from the center of Sandy Hook.

Not that the Mayans are to blame for the hullabaloo over 21 December 2012. On this date, some believe the ancient civilisation expected the end of the world through as many varieties of cataclysm as the internet\\'s servers can hold. The sun will unleash a deadly storm. Earthquakes will tear the planet asunder. A rogue planet will plough into Earth in a cosmic re-creation of bar billiards. No, no, and no.</p><p>There is no doubt the Mayans were big on time. Poke about at the right ancient monuments and you will find reference to dates that go back billions and billions of years. But it is their calendar, the so-called long count cycle, which features here. Put simply, the calendar spans around 5,125 years. Line it up next to a Gregorian calendar, and the last day happens to fall on or around Friday.</p><p>What happens when the calendar ends? Not much. Scientists confidently predict that the worst upheaval we humans face at the end of this, and indeed any other calendar, is the need to get a new calendar. And perhaps nurse a celebratory hangover.</p><p>To their credit \\u2013 because to say nothing might be worse \\u2013 scientists have come forward to explain the fallacy, or sometimes that misinterpreted grain of truth, which lies behind each of the doomsday scenarios. In a move that gave short shrift to hedging, the US space agency released a video intended for 22 December 10 days early. Nasa has called it Why the Earth Did Not End yesterday. Academics did their part too. They traipsed from studio to studio to lay out the mundane truth for TV and radio audiences. Some spoke to otherwise respectable journalists for newspaper articles.</p><p>John Carlson, director of the Centre for Archaeoastronomy at the University of Maryland, is one of only a dozen or so active researchers on the Mayan calendrical system. &quot;I often get asked what\\'s going to happen on the day. I say lots of things are going to happen. Some people will be born. Some people will die. A car headlight will burn out. There will be earthquakes, like there are every day. And none of this will have anything to do with the ancient Mayan calendar,&quot; he says.</p><p>Lest there be any doubt, he speaks the next lines loudly and slowly: &quot;There are no ancient Maya prophecies for anything to happen on this date. There. Are. None.&quot;</p><p>And yet, it seems, some people prepare. From Italy come reports of a lawyer who plans to ride out Armageddon in a bunker built under his villa. In parts of Russia, the shelves were emptied of fuel, matches, sugar and candles, supposedly in anticipation of something worse than winter in Russia. The French government\\'s sect watchdog, <a href=\"http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/\" title=\"\">Miviludes</a>, has an eye on the idyllic mountain village of Bugarach in case doomsday cults arrive, after word got around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/19/bugarach-french-village-survive-mayan-apocalypse\" title=\"\">it will be the only place left standing</a>.</p><p>For every person who takes the fantasy seriously \\u2013 to call it a prophecy is an overstatement \\u2013 scores more find it harmless fun. For others, the end of the world is a business opportunity. Dedicated websites flog dried food, gas masks and other cheerless items. Brewers have chipped in with a range of apocalypse-themed beers. And last week, a Chinese furniture maker unveiled a limited supply of 300,000-yuan (&pound;30,000) survival pods. The former farmer claimed the glass-fibre balls could withstand waves 1km high. The Guardian has not seen his workings.</p><p>How did this become a global phenomenon? Carlson traces its roots back to the romanticism of lost cities in the jungle, the beautiful and enigmatic glyphs, and what some considered the mysterious fate of the Mayan people. These ingredients were perfect for potboilers like Sir Henry Rider Haggard\\'s 1896 Mayan fantasy, Heart of the World. But another book may have been more significant. In 1966, the US archaeologist Michael Coe wrote The Maya and, in a section about the calendar, mentioned the word Armageddon. Carlson says that was a key moment. &quot;It was Michael Coe who planted this meme in modern culture,&quot; he says. From then on, the idea was embraced by New Agers, and spread farther through the internet. Today, the number of books on the Mayan calendar is close to 3,000. Probably six are of any worth, says Carlson.</p><p>Why are we fascinated with end of the world scenarios? &quot;In part it\\'s a reflection that we\\'re all obsessed with our own mortality, but there\\'s a wider context. In a strange way, it\\'s kind of comforting to think that when we go the whole thing goes, that we\\'re at a special point in history,&quot; says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chris-french\" title=\"\">Chris French</a>, professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p><p>For doomsday believers, the toughest of times is that moment of anticlimax, when the world keeps turning and the clock ticks on. History has told us the get-outs: claim the world was spared at the last minute, recalculate the date of the apocalypse, or become disillusioned and kick yourself for believing in the first place. Will this week be the last we hear of the end of the world? Don\\'t you believe it. &quot;After this passes, there will be someone else predicting the end of the world,&quot; says Carlson. &quot;Trust me.&quot;</p><h2><strong>Five other things to watch out for this week</strong></h2><p><strong>1</strong> Monday is the 25th birthday of Bradley Manning, the US army soldier accused of passing state secrets to the whistleblowers\\' website WikiLeaks.</p><p><strong>2</strong> On Wednesday, the results of an exceptional resit of GCSE English are released. The resits were allowed after a fall in pass rates in the exams, leading to protests from teachers, parents and pupils.</p><p><strong>3</strong> A presidential election is held in South Korea on Wednesday. Park Geun-hye, the daughter of assassinated dictator Park Chung-hee, is the candidate of the ruling Saenuri party and the favourite. She would be the country\\'s first female president.</p><p><strong>4</strong> On Thursday, Hillary Clinton gives evidence to the US senate foreign relations committee on the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and others in Benghazi, Libya, on 11 September.</p><p><strong>5</strong> On Saturday, the world\\'s most lucrative lottery, El Gordo, is held in Spain.

But many states with Republican legislatures have so far refused \\u2013 handing over that power by default to Washington DC under the new law.</p><p>As many as 32 states \\u2013 including the second and third largest in the union, Texas and Florida \\u2013 will have all or part of their insurance exchanges run by the federal government, <a href=\"http://statehealthfacts.kff.org/comparemaptable.jsp?ind=962&amp;cat=17\">with at least 24 of them entirely run out of Washington</a> by the health and human services department.</p><p>It wasn\\'t supposed to be that way. Republican objections made while the legislation was being drafted saw states given the power to administer their own schemes, rather than entrust its operation to a remote federal bureaucracy. But furious opposition in many Republican-dominated states has flipped that intention on its head.</p><p>Instead it is the Democratic \"blue\" states that have enthusiastically adopted health exchanges and the huge federal subsidies that come with them.</p><p>Ironically, given the outcome, it was liberal Democrats who had argued for the larger pool and lower costs of a single, national insurance exchange \\u2013 but whose arguments were fiercely attacked by Republicans claiming that states would be disenfranchised.</p><p>As of deadline day, states fall into three categories. There are those, such as California, New York and the District of Columbia, that have agreed to run their state exchanges, and will receive federal funding. Then there are those, such as West Virginia and Illinois, that are in a halfway house of partnership with the federal government, whether by accident or design, and will run parts of their exchange.</p><p>And then there are those states that have rejected setting up exchanges \\u2013 such as Texas and South Dakota \\u2013 and so will instead submit to federal control, although they have a later deadline of 15 February 2015 if they want to adopt the partnership with the government option.</p><p>In truth there is a fourth category: Florida, always the outlier. The Sunshine State has simply dragged its feet \\u2013 first hoping the legal challenge it spearheaded and then the 2012 presidential election would kill off the Affordable Care Act. Since the election it has had no time to refine a blueprint.</p><p>It is most likely to default into the federally-run exchange, even if it opts to join at a later date, but no one in Florida, from the governor down, appears willing to make a definitive statement. Florida\\'s state legislature doesn\\'t even plan to debate setting up an exchange until its next session in March 2013.</p><p>Six Republican-denominated states appear to have taken the plunge and submitted blueprints to run their own exchanges in whole or part: Iowa, Mississippi, Idaho, New Mexico and Nevada, along with Utah, which already has a state-run health exchange of its own making.</p><p>In announcing his backing for a state-run exchange, Butch Otter, the Republican governor of Idaho, took the opposite tack to many of his comrades. \"It would be irresponsible of me to simply abandon the field to federal bureaucrats. In the face of uncertainty we must assert our independence and our commitment to self-determination,\" Otter said.</p><p>Yet he must still overcome a hostile legislature in the staunchly Republican state.</p><p>Of the 25 states that have opted in to full federal control, only one \\u2013 New Hampshire \\u2013 is an unambiguously a Democratic-dominated state. But it was public unhappiness with the new healthcare reforms that forced Democratic governor John Lynch to drop plans for a state-run exchange.</p><p>With the bulk of states, and the US population, coming under the federally-run exchanges, the onus is now on Washington to set up its scheme by October 2013 for the start of individual enrolments, with coverage through the exchanges starting in January 2014 \\u2013 a massive task that could determine the ultimate success or failure of Obamacare.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+healthcare&k=US+politics&k=Texas&k=Florida&k=Republicans&k=Democrats\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401126490|2013-11-18T14:51:34Z|d40c1534ecdab1a2606d343dd406a0ad05f822e1 -->',\n",

And yet extraordinary events can beget unusual responses. Obama, in his brief statement on the horrific shootings at Sandy Hook, was visibly shaken. Millions of citizens were moved by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/dec/15/connecticut-shooting-barack-obama-wipes-away-tears-as-he-vows-meaningful-action-video\" title=\"\">video of him speaking</a>: he paused, wiped a tear from his eye, and struggled to finish his&nbsp;remarks.</p><p>But earlier, when Carney was asked whether it was finally time to revisit the long-buried issue of gun control, he demurred, noting that there will be a &quot;day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I do not think today is that day&quot;.</p><p>Obama is famously calm and unflappable. To see him get choked up underscored the monstrousness of what had transpired. To hear him say, &quot;As a country, we have been through this too many times&quot;, and to add that there would need to be &quot;meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics&quot;, may have led some to expect that he will demand that Congress pass a law to prevent guns from being so readily available to troubled youths.</p><p>But the greater sense, by far, was that Carney had spoken for the administration. After four years of ignoring gun control, <em>nothing</em> would change. And so the American left was caught between two conflicting thoughts: that Obama is a humane leader, channelling his nation\\'s emotions; and that he is a coward, unwilling to expend political capital&nbsp;on saving the lives of innocent children. Some were even offended by Obama\\'s remarks, that he reacted&nbsp;not as a president, but as a parent. &quot;Well, that\\'s not good enough,&quot; retorted Paul Waldman and Jaime Fuller of the <a href=\"http://prospect.org/\" title=\"\"><em>American Prospect</em></a>, the influential liberal magazine &quot;He\\'s not just a parent, nor are the men and women in Congress. They\\'re the ones who have the power to do something about it.&quot;</p><p>Americans who favour gun control can often seem outraged but also resigned. After all, it was just five months ago that a man walked into a movie theatre in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/20/aurora-shooting-the-victims-jessica-ghawi\" title=\"\">Aurora</a>, Colorado and attacked the audience with multiple firearms. Twelve were murdered, 58 were wounded. There were calls for national action at the time and yet no action was taken. Gun control was barely even mentioned in the presidential campaign.</p><p>America has, of course, experienced the ugly side of its loose gun restrictions for decades. But the frequency of mass shootings has recently risen. Six of the 12 most deadly in history have been in the past five years. However, even seeing one of their own, Congresswoman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gabrielle-giffords\" title=\"\">Gabrielle Giffords</a>, victimised in such an event in 2011 did not spur Congress to take action. There have been 65 mass shootings since Giffords was wounded.</p><p>And yet this feels as though it may be different. This time, the shock is more extreme, the feeling more visceral and the political pivot \\u2013 towards the need for greater gun control \\u2013 faster and more focused. Perhaps it is because so many of the victims were kindergartners, only five years old. Perhaps, finally, it is because Americans can only tolerate so many senseless deaths from gun violence. Or perhaps gun control is just having a moment. Two weeks ago, after the footballer Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend and himself, NBC sports announcer Bob Costas asked on national television whether gun culture was to blame; and at least <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/11/nfl-guns-seven-players-turn-in-firearms-jovan-belcher_n_2278614.html\" title=\"\">seven NFL players</a> reportedly turned in their guns in the week that followed.</p><p>Gun control enjoyed a brief spike in public awareness after some of the shootings in the 1990s. After a madman went on a killing spree on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, <a href=\"http://www.votemccarthy.com/\" title=\"\">Carolyn McCarthy</a> \\u2013 wife and mother to victims of the shooting \\u2013 became an anti-gun activist. Eventually she won a congressional seat and became a leading advocate for gun control. A federal ban on assault weapons was passed in 1994, and the infamous shootings at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\" title=\"\">Columbine high school</a> in Littleton, Colorado in 1999 seemed to reinforce the urgency of the issue.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But things changed. In 2000, many political observers attributed Al Gore\\'s loss in West Virginia to the unpopularity of gun control in that rural state. The pro-gun lobby became ever more powerful, and declining crime rates caused the issue to slip from the public\\'s mind. The assault weapons ban lapsed in 2004 and has not been renewed. This event alone will not make Congress come to its senses. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/house-of-representatives\" title=\"\">House of Representatives</a> is controlled by the Republican party. The recent increase in devastating hurricanes has not changed their minds on global warming, so why should 20 dead children change their minds about gun control?</p><p>The Senate also has a strong rural bias: sparsely populated states, where gun control is less popular, get as many senators as California. What\\'s more, rightwing ideologues on the US supreme court have recently broken with precedent and declared that the second amendment of the US constitution guarantees <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91911807\" title=\"\">an individual the right to bear arms</a>. (For most of US history it was understood by experts of every political persuasion to have been intended to ensure the right of states to arm a militia, not <em>individuals</em> to keep guns in one\\'s home or one\\'s person.)</p><p>For stricter gun control to be instituted in the US would require a mass movement. First, a clear majority of Americans would have to be persuaded, and then they would have to apply sufficient pressure that either Republicans shift their position or Democrats retake Congress and&nbsp;develop the fortitude to pass laws.</p><p>And to stop events such as Sandy Hook would require more than just reinstating the assault weapons ban. The gunman, Adam Lanza, used pistols taken from his mother\\'s house and legally registered in her name. Americans would have to accept what their counterparts in other developed countries have: that even law-abiding citizens should not possess guns, because once they are in circulation they do more harm than good.</p><p>Should such a movement take off, it will have leaders at the ready. Congresswoman McCarthy said on Friday that she had already warned the White House before the election that she will be pressuring Obama to advance gun control legislation, and publicly &quot;embarrassing&quot; him on the subject if necessary. Former Congresswoman Giffords\\'s husband Mark Kelly wrote on his Facebook page: &quot;This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook elementary school and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws.&quot;</p><p>It is telling that the most vociferous advocates of gun control are the spouses of shooting victims. It reminds us that long after politicians and the public have moved on and largely forgotten, the victims and their loved ones have not. If enough of their country join them in staying committed to this issue, change may eventually come.</p><p></p><p><em>Ben Adler, a US political commentator, writes for the Nation</em></p><p></p><p><em>\\u2022 </em>This article was amended on 15 December 2012.

Nine people died.</p><p>\"If Morsi doesn\\'t back down there will be bloodshed,\" warned Saeed Ahmad, a grizzled mechanic who came to Ettihadiyeh prepared to become a martyr to defend the freedoms won since Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February 2011. \"The <em>Ikhwan </em>(Arabic for the Brotherhood) are traitors to the revolution.\"</p><p>Protests began late last month after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/22/mohamed-morsi-mubarak-retrial-egypt\" title=\"\">Morsi granted himself sweeping powers </a>to push the new constitution through a drafting body that was dominated by Islamists and boycotted by the opposition. Brotherhood premises have been attacked across the country. The city of Mahalla al-Kubra in the Nile delta has even declared itself an autonomous republic.</p><p>Many of the draft constitution\\'s 236 articles are bland and unexceptionable, but there is bitter disagreement about the role of Islam and clerical scholars, the definition of family values and the position of the military \\u2013 all key issues in the messy transition to a post-Mubarak era.</p><p>Mohamed ElBaradei, co-ordinator of the newly-formed opposition National Salvation Front, initially demanded the referendum be postponed and the constition\\'s text redrafted, warning that \"civil war\" could erupt, but now backs a \"no\" vote. \"It is a constitution for the 18th century, not the 21st,\" protests Mounir Fakhry Abdel-Nour a liberal grandee. \"It means Iran on the banks of the Nile.\"</p><p>It could, some admit, have been worse if Salafi fundamentalists had got their way in the constituent assembly before its Christian, secular and liberal members walked out. \"For the sake of a slightly better constitution the opposition are risking everything,\" warns one western observer. \"Most people haven\\'t even read it,\" says another.</p><p>Still, vital issues are at stake. The biggest fear is that, having abandoned their initial caution to take control of both legislature and the executive under a president who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/24/muslim-brotherhood-egypt-president-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">commanded just 51% of the vote in June</a>, the <em>Ikhwan</em> will be able to use the new constitution to run the courts as well as lower levels of government.</p><p>The judiciary \\u2013 still dominated by Mubarak-era appointees \\u2013 is especially anxious. \"This is the worst period in Egypt\\'s history,\" said Judge Abdel-Azim al-Ashri after facing intimidation by Morsi supporters. Most judges have refused to supervise the referendum.</p><p>\"It\\'s not just that the Brotherhood are trying to ram through their own Islamist agendas,\" argues the commentator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/issandr-el-amrani\" title=\"\">Issandr El Amrani</a>, \"it is that they are behaving in a high-handed and non-consensual way. Their actions seem to speak to a fear that at this long-awaited moment power is going to be snatched away from them.\"</p><p>Mohamed el-Beltagy, the influential secretary general of the Brotherhood\\'s Freedom and Justice Party, appears to confirm this analysis. \"Unfortunately the counter-revolution has succeeded in creating this sense of polarisation,\" he said. \"It\\'s not just made up of those who disagree with the Islamist viewpoint but the <em>felool</em> (remnants of the old regime) and their paid thugs. I do not believe that the problem is the contents of the constitution or presidential decrees. This is an attempt to overturn the table.\"</p><p>Beltagy \\u2013 flatteringly profiled in western media last year as the acceptable face of moderate Islamism \\u2013 made waves this week when he said the security services had reported that 60% of the Ettihadiyeh demonstrators were Coptic Christians. \"I am just stating a fact,\" he told the Guardian impassively, refusing to be drawn on the implications of identifying political opponents by their religious affiliation.</p><p>Talk of conspiracies is rife on both sides. The anti-Morsi camp warns of the danger of assassinations and hints that the army, now back in its barracks, might need to intervene. The president\\'s chief of staff signalled that if the security forces did not do their job, the Brotherhood would protect itself. Prosecutors are reportedly investigating claims that the UAE government \\u2013 a fierce opponent of Islamists everywhere \\u2013 is financing death squads targeting Brotherhood leaders.</p><p>Mohamed Badie, the supreme guide of the Brotherhood, used language taken straight from the Mubarak era when he warned in his weekly message of \"hidden hands\" working to undo the stability achieved by Egypt\\'s post-revolutionary institutions.</p><p>On Thursday, Salafi vigilantes burned the car of a critical TV producer. \"Private media is the chief impediment to the conclusion of the Islamist project as it intentionally smears our image,\" explained Gamal Saber, a supporter of the Salafi preacher Hazem Abu Ismail. Other groups have said they will call for jihad if the constitution is defeated.</p><p>Morsi\\'s critics call him indecisive, issuing his decree <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/09/egypt-mohamed-morsi-cancels-decree\" title=\"\">only to rescind most of it</a> in the face of outrage and then announcing and quickly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/11/egypt-imf-loan-delay-morsi\" title=\"\">cancelling unpopular tax increases</a> that were seen as vital for a \\xa33bn IMF loan to go ahead.</p><p>Opinions are divided on Morsi\\'s core beliefs. \"[He] is an arch-pragmatist who makes terrible misjudgments, but he should not be demonised,\" says a western diplomat.</p><p>Egyptians retort that they are still suspicious of the Brotherhood \\u2013 a long suppressed and famously disciplined organisation whose Islamist ideology is not in doubt, and which has a bad habit of being frank and assertive in Arabic and less so in English.</p><p>\"For many years I used to believe that we could not have a proper democracy without Islamists taking part,\" admits Hossam Bahgat of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"But judging from the last few months I realise that I was wrong. Now there is a very clear line between Islamists and others.\"</p><p>The risk is that the current polarisation could make things worse. \"I don\\'t believe Morsi set out to be a dictator but he might accidentally wind up becoming one,\" suggests Elijah Zarwan of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank. \"The opposition might help him down that road by trying to press their perceived advantage too far. The more confrontational this is the higher the stakes \\u2013 and the more dangerous it becomes.\"The hope in the secular revolutionary camp is that the Brotherhood will suffer in the next parliamentary elections because of its poor performance so far. \"I am surprised at how fast people are linking the Brotherhood to their bread and butter issues,\" said activist Amr Gharbeia. \"These are the real problems in Egypt. But if they are not settled by votes they will be settled in the streets.\"</p><p>Egyptians are being urged to vote yes to the constitution in order to \"move the country forward\" \\u2013 a reference to worries about the economy, jobs and services. The deaths of 50 kindergarten children in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/17/egyptian-bus-crash-kills-children\" title=\"\">bus crash near Assiut last month</a>  \\u2013 just as Morsi was being hailed for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza \\u2013 was a terrible reminder of rickety infrastructure in a country where trains routinely crash, ferries sink and buildings collapse.</p><p>\"The government failed to accomplish anything that would make us proud of it as a post-revolution administration,\" the April 6 youth movement said at the time.</p><p>Yet for all their divisions, Egyptians\\' yearning for stability may be enough to get the constitution passed. \"Morsi hasn\\'t betrayed the revolution but he\\'s on the way,\" said Abdel-Aziz, a Cairo telecoms engineer who moonlights as a taxi driver.</p><p>Many believe the Brotherhood will pull it off. \"Liberal friends of mine voted for Morsi because they said anyone was better than that bastard Mubarak,\" recalled Ahmed el-Gohary, a businessman and the son of a general, who describes himself unapologetically as a <em>felool</em>. \"They said that if we don\\'t like the Brotherhood we could have another revolution and get rid of them. Now they regret it and I keep saying, \\'I told you so.\\' So I am going to vote no to the constitution but I am afraid that it will pass. They have the power of Allah, and that can get anything through.\"</p><h2>Timeline: two years of revolution and upheaval</h2><p><strong>25 January 2011</strong> Egyptian revolution begins as crowds gather to protest against President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo\\'s Tahrir Square.</p><p><strong>11 February</strong> Mubarak steps down, replaced by the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (Scaf).

If Kerry is chosen, his seat in the United States Senate will be subject to a special election in 2013. Republicans almost certainly have zero chance of winning \\u2013 unless soon-to-be-former Senator Scott Brown, who just lost to Democrat Elizabeth Warren, runs.</p><p>The question is, will he?</p><p>The reason for Brown <em>not</em> to run is pretty clear: winning federal office as a Republican in Massachusetts is hard. Excluding Brown\\'s 2010 victory, the last time a Republican was elected to the United States Senate from Massachusetts was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Massachusetts,_1972\">in 1972</a>. There hasn\\'t been a single Republican elected to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_delegations_from_Massachusetts\">House of Representatives from Massachusetts</a> since Peter Blute and Peter Torkildsen won during the \"Republican revolution\" of 1994. That includes no Republicans elected to the House during the Republican romp in 2010 and John Tierney\\'s <a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2012/11/07/tierney-tisei-in-tight-race-in-mass-6th-district/\">miraculous survival</a>, despite major ethics problems, in 2012.</p><p>Indeed, you could argue that Brown\\'s victory in 2010 was a fluke more than anything else. Brown\\'s opponent, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, ran arguably the worst campaign the state had ever seen. She <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2035312_2035705,00.html\">refused to do much of anything</a> in the way of retail politics \\u2013 and bragged about it. Coakley made herself an object of ridicule by stating that Boston Red Sox hero Curt Schilling was a member of the hated New York Yankees.</p><p>Brown, by contrast, rode his <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,583313,00.html\">pickup truck</a> around Massachusetts, winning over voters under the radar, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/senate/ma/massachusetts_senate_special_election-1144.html\">reversed a 30-point deficit</a> in the closing weeks of the campaign. But it\\'s improbable that Brown would catch such a break again.</p><p>Even if Brown were to win in 2013, he\\'d face another election in 2014: the seat currently occupied by Kerry is due for its regular election in 2014. A Republican winning a Senate seat in Massachusetts three times in five years could be considered equivalent to Adam Sandler winning an Oscar three times in five years.</p><p>Brown also has another option for a powerful statewide office: governor. Unlike senatorial elections, Republicans have actually had a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Massachusetts#List_of_Governors\">string of success in capturing the governor\\'s mansion</a>. Republicans won four consecutive gubernatorial elections from 1990 to 2002, including Mitt Romney\\'s bid in 2002. The reason is that Democratic-leaning voters in Massachusetts don\\'t have to worry that Republican governors will have to vote for the national Republican agenda, as they might be obliged to if elected to federal office.</p><p>So, is Brown <em>not</em> running for Senate a sure thing?</p><p>No. Brown might not find the post of governor too alluring upon deep thought. He might prefer the Senate and would discount the seemingly long odds. In any case, the past doesn\\'t necessarily predict the future. Brown\\'s loss in his 2012 race to Senator-elect Liz Warren was, at least partially, because of the demographics in presidential elections. Black voters <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/09/white-voter-decline-2012-conundrum\">turned out in higher numbers</a> for Obama than they would have otherwise; 18- to 29-year-old turnout also is <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/polls/#USH00p1\">usually depressed</a> in non-presidential years.</p><p>I wanted to find out what Brown\\'s loss in 2012 might have looked like under the 2010 special election turnout. The problem is that there were no exit polls taken for the special election. There was a survey conducted by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/2010-01-21electorate-comparison.pdf&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">telephone afterward</a>, but exit polls tend to find more minorities and younger people than telephone surveys. The <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2012-exit-poll/MA/Senate\">2012 exit poll</a> also found an electorate that was actually 7pt <em>more</em> white in 2012 than in <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#MAP00p1\">2008</a>, which a <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/110068/the-overlooked-question-2016-the-future-black-turnout\">whole host of evidence</a> indicates was almost certainly not the case.</p><p>We can still get a decent idea of what would have occurred in special and midterm elections based on a number of factors, including voter age, ideology (<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/08/01/cbsnytquinnipiac_swing_state_polls__party_id-2.html\">more consistent from survey to survey than party identification</a>), and race. Warren\\'s margin of victory of 7pt in 2012 probably would have dropped by to only a 4pt win with special election or <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/MA/G/00/epolls.0.html\">midterm turnout</a>. This is not enough to erase her margin of victory, yet it\\'s a significant reduction. Without Obama on the top of the ticket, you could make the argument that Brown might have made it much closer.</p><p>Still, the fact that Brown would have lost to Warren based on reasonable demographic assumptions is a big warning sign to him. When I look at this math plus history, it tends to suggest to me that Brown would be wise to pass on a Senate run. If he is still ambitious for a return to high political office, governor is where he should focus his attention.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Massachusetts&k=John+Kerry&k=US+Senate&k=US+politics&k=Republicans&k=Susan+Rice\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401079185|2013-11-18T14:51:35Z|07838d173307b4daafe1133313e4b982529e4ae6 -->',\n",

Then Obama was reelected and the continued campaign against Rice began to look especially unhinged.</p> <p>Consider Iowa Rep. Steve King, who today said the Benghazi scandal is 10 times bigger than the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals combined, the <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121213/NEWS09/121213015/1007/news05\">Washington Times reported</a> (h/t: @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/batterdippin\">batterdippin</a>):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;(Watergate) was a break-in that Nixon had no knowledge of at the time.

In late November, John Heilemann in New York Magazine went so far as to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/politics/powergrid/susan-rice-secretary-of-state-2012-12/\">list five reasons </a>why a Rice confirmation was a done deal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a rule, your columnist avoids predictions, but in the spirit of holiday indulgence, I will make an exception here: Not only will Obama appoint Rice to succeed Clinton but she will be confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\\'s Heilemann\\'s fourth reason:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>4. Because McCain is being a jackass\\u2014and Obama is sick of it.</strong>&nbsp;Arguably more than any other national figure, the senior senator from Arizona is driven in every aspect of his public behavior by personal pique. In the wake of the 2000 Republican nomination fight, when he believed Bush and his campaign had defeated him by nefarious means, McCain lunged to the center and became one of the sharpest thorns in the side of the new president from his own party. In the wake of the 2008 election, when he was soundly thumped by a Democratic challenger whom he regarded as a neophyte and a pretender whose experience and valor were no match for his own, McCain immediately shed all traces of mavericky independence and became one of Obama\\u2019s fiercest critics from the right.

Kerry was also the Mitt Romney stand-in during presidential debate practice.</p> <p>Rice had the necessary diplomatic credentials. She has been right about more issues than she has been wrong, being an early champion of the West taking a tougher line on the Darfur issue. But when she has failed, she has failed badly. She was responsible for African affairs in the Clinton administration, and critics \\u2013 fairly or unfairly \\u2013 blame her for doing little to prevent the rapid disintegration of the Congo, a conflict that is estimated to have cost at least two million lives.</p> <p>On a small scale, she was humiliated a fortnight ago when the UN general assembly voted in favour of a step towards Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>Showing none of the humility such a defeat deserved, she put her head down in the assembly to read out a defiant statement that would have pleased few outside of Israel.</p> <p>Kerry, chairman of the Senate foreign affairs committee, has much wider experience in the diplomatic world, and knows already many of the world leaders. </p> <p>Rice\\'s departure from the field will be greeted with relief in foreign ministries round the world who have been on the receiving end of her rough tongue: that is, most of them.

J. Christopher Stevens, a computer technician and two security contractors employed by the CIA.</p> <p>The Obama administration, led publicly by Rice, initially made the attack on a US mission out to be part of a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islam video that had provoked such a protest that day in Cairo and elsewhere.</p> <p>Later it emerged that there was no protest, that the attack was planned and that the mission was attached to a covert CIA post.</p> <p>Five days after the attack, Rice made this misleading statement on NBC\\'s Meet the Press:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video.</p> <p>Opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding.

Rice went to lengths to woo the biggest of the pro-Israel lobby groups, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).</p> <p>Rice has also come under strong criticism over her positions on Africa, most recently for trying to suppress a UN report strongly critical of the Rwandan government\\'s arming and other support for rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p>Rice was a national security official in Bill Clinton\\'s White House who played a part in the US\\'s failure to act against the 1994 genocide of Rwanda\\'s Tutsis. Since then she has been an unswerving supporter of the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, who as a Tutsi rebel leader put a stop to the genocide even in the face of a growing body of evidence his forces are bound up with years of war crimes in Congo.</p> <p>Rice has also come under criticism for supporting other authoritarian leaders in Africa.

I am grateful that Susan will continue to serve as our Ambassador at the United Nations and a key member of my cabinet and national security team, carrying her work forward on all of these and other issues. I have every confidence that Susan has limitless capability to serve our country now and in the years to come, and know that I will continue to rely on her as an advisor and friend.

The Turkish foreign minister said Syria is known to have 700 with a limited number of launchers. And those are spread across longer range, up to 700km, and shorter range missiles. I would assume that the missiles fired were shorter range, probably Scud Bs.</p> <p>They have terrible accuracy. I think what we are seeing is a regime that is being pushed. Now with rebel advances particularly taking over certain bases, and their likely possession of shoulder fired anti-aircraft missiles, Assad is running out of options.</p> <p>Military planners don\\u2019t rely on Scuds to do much of anything, because they are so inaccurate. They are really useful for large targets. There are reports that these were for a military base, but we are not talking about pin-point strikes here. We are talking about shooting in the general direction and hoping they land where they are supposed to.</p> <p>I see it more as Assad being desperate and having very few options left to take back territory that he has lost. I don\\u2019t see this as him sending a message to the international community, but simply trying to hold on as tightly as he can to power.</p> </blockquote> <p>In theory Nato\\u2019s patriot missile system, on its way to Turkey, should be able to shoot Scud missiles down if they are targeted across the border, Stein said.</p> <p>Asked about the current attitude to Syria in Washington, he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are genuine concerns that Assad is getting desperate and could use chemical weapons as a last resort. We have to keep in mind that this man who is fighting for his life and feels completely threatened. There is a palpable concern in Washington that he might resort to using these weapons.</p> <p>What could he possibly being doing? There were reports that he was mixing chemicals. I don\\u2019t think he was mixing chemicals per se. But he could have been preparing chemicals shells or chemical warheads for delivery.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if Scud missiles could fall into rebel hands, Stein said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would assume he has moved Scud missiles to places or bases that are outside of rebel controlled territory.

It\\u2019s controlled by the rebels. And those rebels have advanced surface-to-air missiles that can take down regime planes. It\\u2019s not hard to see why Assad\\u2019s commanders might elect to fire off a few Scuds instead \\u2014 especially as the rebels continue to make advances on key regime facilities.</p> <p>Robert Farley, a professor at the University of Kentucky, said the use of the Scuds most likely indicated an attempt to strike deep inside rebel-held territory, since they have a longer range than Assad\\u2019s artillery. They probably also indicate that Assad is freaked out about the rebels\\u2019 potential to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/12/syria-chemical-weapons-3/\">shoot down his planes and helicopters</a>&nbsp;with shoulder-fired missiles. \\u201cA typical fighter bomber can deliver a lot more ordnance, probably with more accuracy,\\u201d Farley tells Danger Room. \\u201cYou use these for surprise, or because you\\u2019re concerned about enemy air defences.\\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Shashank Joshi, research fellow at the&nbsp;Royal United Services Institute, takes a similar line.

Missiles are deterrents, and actually firing them \\u2013 wherever they might land, and despite NATO\\u2019s deployment of the Patriot missile defence system to Turkey \\u2013 tends to concentrates the mind in Western capitals.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Joshi pointed out that since he wrote the article the New York Times has reported that the missiles were fired at military bases, which he says <a href=\"http://twitter.com/shashj/statuses/279171345168867330\">makes more military sense</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/world/middleeast/syria-war-developments-assad.html\">NYT said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Scuds have been fired since Monday from the An Nasiriyah Air Base, north of Damascus, according to American officials familiar with the classified intelligence reports about the attacks.

It has largely lost Aleppo and the north of the country. It has lost the east of the country. But it still holds vast amounts of the country. It has a military that is the strongest single militia in Syria. It has got extraordinary weapons still. It has got an air force, which the rebels do not have.

And it has, most importantly, this small ethnic group, or sectarian group, the Alawites, who are about 2.5 million people and are highly trained in the military and believe that they could be slaughtered if they just lay down their guns ... they are going to fight like the dickens to hold on to what they have.

The official said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Allied intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets have detected the launch of a number of unguided, short-range ballistic missiles inside Syria this week \\u2026 Trajectory and distance travelled indicate they were Scud-type missiles.</p> </blockquote> <p>\\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/12/us-syrian-moaz-al-khatib-opposition-coalition\"><strong>The Obama administration has invited the head of the newly recognised Syrian rebel coalition, Moaz al-Khatib, to Washington as the US attempts to build a sympathetic administration to slot into place and keep hostile Islamist forces at bay when Assad falls.</strong> </a>The invitation was made at the Friends of Syria meeting in Morocco where&nbsp;Khatib flagged up his concern at American attempts to separate his National Coalition from some of those doing the fighting after the US designated one of the rebel groups, the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate and a terrorist organisation.</p> <p>\\u2022 <a href=\"http://alhayat.com/Details/461404\"><strong>Robert Ford, the US ambassador to Syria, has defended Washington\\'s decision to blacklist the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organisation.</strong> </a>Writing in al-Hayat, he says:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We call on all responsible actors to speak out against and distance themselves from al-Nusrah Front, Shabiha, Jaysh Al-Shaib, and other violent extremists who seek and intend to hijack this Syrian struggle.

South Africa suffered rising public protests, credit rating downgrades, education failures, a verbal brawl over a painting of the presidential privates and a massacre of 34 striking workers in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/07/marikana-mine-shootings-revive-soweto\" title=\"\">bloodiest state crackdown since racial apartheid</a>.</p><p>Many presidents would dread a leadership contest at the end of such a year, especially when a 248m rand (\\xa318m) security <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/jacob-zuma-investigation-plans-home\" title=\"\">upgrade of his private residence</a> has become another political firestorm. Yet Jacob Zuma goes to the ANC conference in Mangaung next week <a href=\"http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=344998&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71619\" title=\"\">widely expected to receive a vote of confidence</a>, in effect guaranteeing him the most powerful job in Africa until 2019.</p><p>In his wood-panelled office in Pretoria, Zuma did not appear burdened by history or the Cassandras who foresee burning towers and a Zimbabwe-like fall for the nation of Nelson Mandela. The 70-year-old was breezy, upbeat and hard to dislike, a demeanour his supporters perceive as steady pragmatism \\u2013 and his detractors see as hopelessly glib and out of touch. The <a href=\"http://www.da.org.za/newsroom.htm?action=view-news-item&amp;id=11661\" title=\"\">official opposition gave him a F-grade</a> for 2012 and is seeking a parliamentary vote of no confidence.</p><p>In a wide-ranging interview, he discussed the mining crisis, his nemesis, Julius Malema, gay rights in Africa and <em>that</em> painting.</p><p>\"Nobody expected Marikana,\" said Zuma, of the police shooting of workers at the Lonmin platinum mine in August. \"But I think you can\\'t fail to appreciate that Marikana happened in a democratic country. If it was during apartheid, there were many Marikanas almost on a daily basis, and there was nothing that anyone could do.\"</p><p>He said the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the shootings showed how South Africa had changed. \"You would not have had that during apartheid days. That\\'s the beauty of democracy, because it doesn\\'t mean that when you have got democracy there will be no such mishap and shocking things. I think the test is how does the country handles that. To me, that is the difference.\"</p><p>But in most democracies would not <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/tag/nathi-mthethwa\" title=\"\">the police minister</a>, at least, have fallen on his sword? \"Well, I don\\'t know about other countries. Again it\\'s a question of how people look into that. What is it that caused Marikana, really?\"</p><p>A dispute over wages had led to unrest, he said. \"Now you can\\'t say the minister of police is responsible for that, to start the thing. When the workers were striking, they had every other kind of weapon in their hands. In fact, long before the shooting, 10 people had died, including two policemen, two security policemen.\"</p><p>In a vein likely to anger families and supporters of the slain mineworkers, Zuma asked: \"How many other people would have died if, for example, police did not move to disarm these people? Nobody can tell. At a spur of the moment, a mistake happened. Now if such a mistake happened, you throw the minister away? I don\\'t know on what basis.\"</p><p>Marikana could be the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/marikana-turning-point-south-africa\" title=\"\">defining event of Zuma\\'s presidency</a> and has certainly shone a harsh light on South Africa\\'s mining sector, where for more than a century lack of safety has cost well in excess of 50,000 lives. Migrant workers continue to live far from their families in grim conditions, carrying out hazardous work for what many argue is pitifully low pay.</p><p>In what appeared to be a warning to international mining companies such as Lonmin, which is listed on the London stock exchange, Zuma said: \"If we don\\'t tackle the change, and that mining should transform, you will from time to time have such situations. It\\'s not the first time that people have this kind of strike wherein many people die. We\\'ve got to transform that, particularly if it is one of the backbones of our industry.</p><p>\"The conditions of workers should change. They can\\'t continue to be what they were many decades ago. I would imagine Marikana in a democratic South Africa has been a wake-up call to say: let us fix the conditions of the workers and make the conditions to be in keeping with what this industry is producing. I think it contributes a lot in terms of the economy. It almost borders on exploitation, as it were, the conditions of employment, the level of the salary, etc. I believe this is a moment to transform.\"</p><p>The interview, conducted before Mandela\\'s admission to hospital with a lung infection put the nation on edge, took place at South Africa\\'s version of the White House. The light sandstone <a href=\"http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=187\" title=\"\">Union Buildings</a>, at 99 a year younger than the ANC, are a visual metaphor for the republic\\'s rich and sometimes jarring contradictions. Designed by Sir Herbert Baker, the \"Union\" refers to that of Boers and British, not the black majority; statues of Botha and Hertzog dominate the lawns; first world war memorials carry mostly Anglo-Saxon names. It was in the midst of all this that Mandela was inaugurated in 1994 and Zuma 15 years later.</p><p>Political liberation has been achieved but, ask Zuma\\'s critics on the left, has economic liberation been sacrificed? The latest census shows <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20138322\" title=\"\">white people still earn six times more than black people</a>, though the gap is slowly narrowing, while a recent study found that <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/12/06/uk-safrica-inequalities-idUKBRE8B511N20121206\" title=\"\">black people directly own less than 10% of the Johannesburg stock market</a>.</p><p>\"We have a history in South Africa of an entrenched white monopoly capital,\" Zuma said. \"The economy in South Africa was racially structured for many decades, if not centuries. I don\\'t think in 18 years you could solve that unless you have a miracle. I think we\\'ve got all the policies in place to deal with that issue.\"</p><p>Black people had been denied access to the mainstream economy and to education, he added, but nationalising mines or seizing farms were not the answer. \"It\\'s a tough struggle to deal with that and therefore the monopoly continues. In other places, they get freedom, they say, \\'Sorry, we nationalise,\\' and it has had its own consequences in other countries. We are a constitutional democracy. We must deal with things properly within the framework of the law and then the constitution. I think we are making good inroads, which I think is in keeping with the massive programme of education we are putting in place.\"</p><p>Yet South Africa is one of the most unequal societies on the planet. The ANC\\'s union allies have warned of a \"<a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/business/business-news/vavi-sa-faces-ticking-time-bomb-1.1035095\" title=\"\">ticking timebomb</a>\" with unemployment at 36.2% hitting young black people especially hard. Bishop Jo Seoka, president of the South African Council of Churches, recently warned that a revolution could go from mines and wine farms to townships to suburbs. Moeletsi Mbeki, a political economist and brother of the former president Thabo Mbeki, predicted <a href=\"http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/02/10/wealth-creation\" title=\"\">South Africa\\'s \"Tunisia Day\" will come in 2020</a>.</p><p>Will the country blow?</p><p>\"I don\\'t think there\\'s a ticking timebomb,\" Zuma said. \"Unemployment is a global issue \\u2026 but in South Africa it gets exaggerated precisely because of the history, because of the fact that of the unemployed, quite a good percentage is unemployable, and this is what we\\'ve got to deal with. If there were no measures taken to deal with the problem, I\\'ll be saying people are correct.\"</p><p>Such an answer is unlikely to satisfy Malema, who as president of the ANC youth league called for radical steps to overhaul the economy. He was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/01/anc-african-national-congress-southafrica\" title=\"\">expelled for ill-discipline</a> this year.</p><p>Asked how he felt about Malema\\'s personal attacks, Zuma replied: \"I don\\'t feel much because to me it has exposed what type of a person he is, it has exposed the depth of his politics, it has exposed to me the level of his care and love of the organisation. When he says he loves it, anyone who loves this organisation does not behave like that. I don\\'t think I\\'ve got time to waste on such matters really.\"</p><p>Is Malema\\'s political career finished? \"Well, I\\'m not going to guess that, but I think it will depend on how people move. You could have your political career continue but in a totally different way. But in the ANC he has been expelled, and I\\'m not certain that he\\'s doing anything for people to think expelling was not the right remedy.\"</p><p>Malema has tried to land any punch on Zuma that he can, including the president\\'s private life: he is a traditional Zulu polygamist with four wives and 21 children. He has been criticised for culturally fundamentalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/22/jacob-zuma-women-unmarried\" title=\"\">remarks about women</a> and gay people. Other leaders on the continent have described homosexuality as \"unAfrican\". So where does Zuma stand on gay marriage, which was legalised by South Africa in 2006 \\u2013 the first African country to do so?</p><p>\"That does not necessarily require my view; it requires the views of South Africans,\" he said carefully. \"We have a constitution that is very clear that we all respect, which I respect. It has a view on that one, that gay marriage is a constitutionally accepted thing in South Africa. So no matter what my views would be.\"</p><p>Asked how he would react if one of his children told him they were gay, Zuma replied: \"I\\'d react in a particular way, but she or he would have taken a decision. I would respect that, for that\\'s what the constitution says. There are small things that would have made me to have a feeling, otherwise I would not be a parent. If for example I had a child, and I\\'m sure I would want to have a grandchild one day, no matter how much I accept the reality but inside I would be saying, \\'I wish I would have had a grandchild, but nevertheless the person has taken the decision, on the constitution I must accept.\\'\"</p><p>Zuma\\'s own sex life became a talking point in 2012 when he was depicted as Lenin with exposed genitals in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/21/jacob-zuma-court-painting-genitals\" title=\"\">Brett Murray\\'s satirical painting The Spear</a>. The president\\'s supporters marched on the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg and two protesters defaced the artwork. There was a toxic debate about art, race and the right to offend in which people mostly talked past each other.</p><p>What did The Spear say about South Africa today? \"There will be individuals who think differently. I don\\'t think in a country you can have people thinking and feeling exactly the same. I think it is people have got their own ideas, they want to express them. I might have a view about it, but some people might have a different view about it.</p><p>\"I thought it was rather vulgar,\" Zuma said. \"Particularly if you portray a particular person (that way), but of course I think the population did express itself at that time, which will tell you it is not everybody who approved of it. I think in fact the majority did not approve of it \\u2026 Some white people, for example, thought that was not helpful to deal with the race issue in the country.\"</p><p>The ANC, Africa\\'s oldest liberation movement, has much to be proud of but, after 18 years in government, has by its own admission committed \"<a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-stepping-stone-to-personal-gain-motlanthe-1.1433878\" title=\"\">sins of incumbency</a>\". It goes to conference wracked by infighting that Zuma insists is the lifeblood of internal democracy.

I won\\u2019t claim we are making any noticeable impact. We might be able to reach 1,000 or 2,000 families, but it is 100,000 families that are in dire need of assistance. As an organisation we feel quite alone in this task.</p> <p>We are a non-governmental organisation from the Czech Republic ... unable to respond to all the critical needs that we see on the ground.</p> <p>The situation in Aleppo is very difficult in terms of survival for these families. Food prices have gone up 300% to 500%. Bread is today 200 Syrian pounds (&pound;1.75). Families simply cannot afford that. Queues in front of bakeries gather as early as 10pm. [They] wait throughout the whole night in order to have a chance to buy subsidised bread.</p> <p>In the area where we work 30% of families have an insufficient food supply. One in 10 families are not eating regularly, children are going hungry. People are dying of asthma because there are no drugs. The situation is simply brutal for the people caught in this fighting.</p> </blockquote> <p>His warning comes as the Syrian opposition is hoping to use a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/11/syrian-opposition-plans-humanitarian-aid\">network of grassroots activists to get aid to areas worst hit by the violence</a>.</p> <p>Przedlacki said genuine grassroots initiatives are beginning to establish law and order in rebel-controlled areas, but they lack capacity and support.</p> <p>After months of conflict self-help initiatives have run out of cash savings and supplies, he warned.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Their pockets are simply empty, so the situation on the ground is deteriorating fast. Week after week there are more and more hungry people. There are more chronically ill dying. There is not enough food available to families. A lot of families have moved into basements because of the bombardment in the city. ... I\\u2019ve been seeing families living in basements of 15m square and you see 15 or 16 children and women just next to each other trying to warm themselves with no access to healthcare, with no access to food, with no access to electricity and under bombardment.</p> <p>For a humanitarian organisation I do believe that is possible to work [here]. The biggest problem is the amount of assistance - it is a drop in the ocean.</p> <p>Part of Aleppo, especially the centre, is under the control of the government. The other areas, to the north and the south, are under the control of the Free Syrian Army. They are fighting with each other on a daily basis.

The rocket disintegrated less than two minutes after liftoff, confirming that the reality of the regime\\'s technological expertise did not match its rhetoric.</p><p>But following the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/12/north-korea-launches-rocket?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">apparently successful launch of a weather observation satellite</a>, the 29-year-old leader has done much to strengthen his legitimacy at home and lay to rest the humiliation of last spring. North Korean state media attributed the launch \\u2013 almost a year after the death of Kim\\'s father, Kim Jong-il \\u2013 to the prowess of all three generations.</p><p>\"At a time when great yearnings and reverence for Kim Jong-il pervade the whole country, its scientists and technicians brilliantly carried out his behests to launch a scientific and technological satellite in 2012, the year marking the 100th birth anniversary of President Kim Il-sung,\" the KCNA news agency said.</p><p>Hotels guests and employees in Pyongyang reportedly applauded when the news was announced on TV and vehicles with loudspeakers informed people on the streets outside.</p><p>Ham Myong-son, a resident of the North Korean capital, told Associated Press that he felt \"proud to have been born a Korean\". Mun Su-kyong, a dancer dressed in bright traditional clothes, said the launch was something to \"boast about to the world\". Another resident, Rim Un-hui, said: \"I\\'m confident that our country will be stronger and more prosperous under the leadership of Kim Jong-un.\"</p><p>Whether by accident or design, North Korea managed to wrongfoot experts, who were convinced that a technical glitch, coupled with bad weather, could delay the launch, possibly until the end of the year. Earlier this week, speculation grew that it would happen on 17 December, the first anniversary of Kim Jong-il\\'s death from a heart attack.</p><p>As a bonus for Pyongyang, the launch prompted a bout of <a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/2012/12/breaking-north-korea-launches-rocket/\" title=\"\">bickering among the two main candidates in next week\\'s South Korean presidential election</a> in South Korea, according to NK news.org.</p><p>A spokesperson for Moon Jae-in, the liberal candidate, said it was evidence of the \"national security incompetence\" of the current president, Lee Myung-bak. An aide to Park Geun-hye, who belongs to the same conservative party as Lee, accused Moon of being \"ignorant of the reason why the international community is concerned and against North Korea\\'s long-range rocket launching test\".</p><p>Like his father, Kim Jong-un appears willing to defy China, North Korea\\'s only major ally, in his determination to make up for April\\'s failed launch. Since then, he has replaced top military officials from the Kim Jong-il era with people he believes he can depend on to create a new regime in his own image. \"This is a considerable boost in establishing the rule of Kim Jong-un,\" Cho Min, an expert at the Korea Institute of National Unification, told Reuters.</p><p>US congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the chair of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee, said: \"The illusion that Kim Jong-un would be any less ruthless or provocative than his father and grandfather before him has gone up in smoke on the missile launch pad.\"</p><p>John Delury, of Yonsei University in Seoul, suggested the North felt it had no choice but to proceed with the latest launch after April\\'s humiliating failure.</p><p>\"They couldn\\'t even try to spin that as a partial success,\" he said. \"They set it up as a big moment to celebrate the centenary of Kim Il-sung, a major celebration, and completely failed \\u2013 and they openly admitted it. I think domestic legitimacy is the primary thing.\"</p><p>Delury questioned how effective fresh sanctions would be, given that similar measures introduced in 2006 and 2009 had not changed the North\\'s behaviour.</p><p>\"In a weird way, the hopeful scenario might be that the launch is successful enough that they can say it was a success and don\\'t need to launch for a while again,\" he said.</p><p>While it remains to be seen whether the satellite will adhere to its intended orbit, its launch is proof of a significant improvement in North Korean technological knowhow. David Wright, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \"If they tried again tomorrow we are not sure it would work again.\" He added that the entire North Korean missile programme appeared somewhat haphazard. \"It looks like a series of stunts. If you did want to use this technology for a military purpose you need a sense of reliability,\" he said.</p><p>The smooth trajectory of a rocket armed with a satellite does not, of course, signal the imminent arming of ballistic missiles \\u2013 the launch\\'s \"hidden\" purpose, according to Japan, the US and South Korea \\u2013 with nuclear warheads capable of striking the US west coast. North Korea is known to have developed about a dozen rudimentary nuclear weapons, but is thought to be a long way off producing warheads small enough to mount on intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said: \"Although North Korea may be developing and testing long-range missiles primarily for propaganda or status, there is a strong suspicion that the activity is linked to North Korea\\'s programme to develop nuclear warheads.</p><p>\"One reason for this is that ballistic missiles generally carry a rather limited warhead, often no more than 1,000kg. Unless the missile is capable of very precise targeting, it makes little sense to load a conventional warhead on to a long-range missile given the cost of the missile and the limited destructive power of such a warhead. The status of North Korea\\'s nuclear warhead development programme is, however, highly uncertain.\"</p><p>Aside from helping Kim Jong-un emerge from his father\\'s shadow, the launch may have strengthened Kim\\'s leverage over the US, just before Barack Obama begins his second term, and will raise tensions with Japan and South Korea, which are preparing to elect new leaders.</p><p>This, the biggest diplomatic coup of Kim\\'s fledgling regime, falls well short of achieving his father\\'s aim of declaring North Korea \"a strong and prosperous nation\"; an estimated third of the population is malnourished and per capita income is less than $2,000 (\\xa31,240) a year. But he has given his stronger and more prosperous critics pause for thought.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=North+Korea&k=Asia+Pacific&k=World+news&k=Nuclear+weapons&k=Japan&k=Kim+Jong-un\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/400938015|2013-11-18T14:51:35Z|a2b5ef5eab8b452af1b206df713bb5331c1238f4 -->',\n",

If they do care, what if any solutions do they favor and who do they trust? </p><p>Polling shows that Americans do care about the fiscal cliff, and that they tend to favor solutions floated by the Democratic party. This is in line with whom they trust on the economy at large. </p><h2>1. People are following the fiscal cliff story.</h2><p>A <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/budget.htm\">recent Gallup poll</a> found that 60% of Americans were following the fiscal cliff story \"very\" or \"somewhat\" closely. A Pew/Washington Post poll paints a picture of an even-closer-watching public, with 66% saying they were watching fiscal cliff news \"very\" or \"somewhat\" closely, including 40% who answered \"very\" closely.</p><h2>2. People are worried about the fiscal cliff</h2><p>Last month, 68% of Americans in a <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/26/cnn-poll-two-thirds-say-fiscal-cliff-poses-major-problem/\">CNN/ORC poll</a> said that if the fiscal cliff were to occur it would cause a crisis or major problems for the United States. This crisis/major problem percentage is nearly 10 points higher than the percentage of Americans who worried about the debt ceiling being raised in the summer of 2011. </p><p>Moreover, Americans are worried about their own finances: 38% said their own financial situation would be affected a great deal if the fiscal cliff were to occur. Another 39% thought their finances would be at least somewhat affected. That\\'s 10 points higher than the percentage who thought their financial situation would be affected if the debt ceiling were not raised during the summer of 2011. </p><h2>3. The National Debt is not a top priority</h2><p>There\\'s isn\\'t too much polling regarding concern about the national debt and the \"fiscal cliff\" specifically, but the <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm\">overall data</a> says Americans aren\\'t worrying about the national debt right now. Only 15% of Americans in a National Journal survey thought that the most concerning issue with regards to new agreements to reduce deficits concerns was that any deal would \"not meet its target for reducing the federal deficit and debt\". In an August 2012 CBS/NY-Times poll, only 7% believed that the budget deficit and/or national debt was the most important problem facing the country.</p><h2>4. Most Americans would love to tax families making more than $250,000 as part of the solution</h2><p>In the last Pew/Washington poll, 48% of Americans wanted the Bush tax cuts to expire only on families making more than $250,000. When you combine that with the 13% who wanted the tax cuts to expire on everyone, you get more than 60% of the American public agreeing that taxes on those families earning more than $250,000 should go up. This survey is well in line with all other data on the subject. </p><h2>5. Most Americans are worried about cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and social security</h2><p>Seventy-nine per cent of Americans do not want Medicare spending cut, per the latest National Journal survey; 63% do not want Medicaid cut. Sixty-seven per cent of Americans in a mid-November Washington Post poll did not want the Medicare age raised from 65 to 67 years old. Seventy-seven per cent of Americans also don\\'t want social security benefits decreased and only 30% want a change in the way annual increases are calculated. </p><h2>6. Americans are more evenly split on cutting defense</h2><p>In the last National Journal poll, 64% of Americans wanted either a a lot or some cut in defense spending to reduce the federal budget. That was the highest number for any solution to bring down the federal deficit. An AP-GfK poll was more split, with 40% of Americans favoring reducing federal spending on defense and 44% being opposed. Despite the lower percentage, it was among the more popular responses in that survey to reduce the deficit. </p><h2>7. The Democrats have the upper hand on the fiscal cliff</h2><p>In a just-released Gallup poll, 48% of Americans approve of the Obama administration\\'s handling of the fiscal cliff issue. That\\'s higher than the 38% approval of Democratic leaders in Congress. Both of these, however, are better than the mere 26% of Americans who approve of the job Republican leaders in Congress have done during the fiscal cliff negotiations. If no agreement is reached by the end of the year, 47% of respondents in a McClatchy/Marist survey said they will blame Congressional Republicans; only 36% will blame President Obama.</p><h2>8. Americans are optimistic that a deal will be made</h2><p>Even as Americans worry about the fiscal cliff, they don\\'t believe it will end in disaster. In the Gallup survey, 59% of Americans believed it was at least somewhat likely that an agreement would be made before 1 January. This is the same percentage as 10 days ago, so Americans are not growing pessimistic even as talks drag. </p><h2>9. Americans believe the economy is improving</h2><p>Hope in fiscal cliff negotiations mirrors Americans\\' thoughts on the the overall economic picture \\u2013 that it is getting better. In a November NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, 52% of Americans answered that economy was recovering. Similarly, in an October Pew poll only 36% of Americans answered that it \"will be a long time before the economy recovers\". This was the lowest percentage in two years. Gallup\\'s consumer confidence rating has been bouncing around its four-year high since Obama\\'s re-election. </p><h2>10. Democrats are winning the overall economic argument</h2><p>During the presidential campaign, Republicans were winning on the issue of the economy. That\\'s not the case anymore. By six points, Americans favor Democrats on handling the economy, per AP-GfK. By three points, Americans favor Democrats on the normally Republican-friendly question of managing the federal budget deficit. Democrats also win by four points on handling taxes. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Thus, the fiscal cliff picture matches the economic picture at large. Americans are worried about the fiscal cliff, but think that there is hope on the horizon. That hope is invested in a belief that the Democratic Party will lead Americans out of the economic mess of the past few years.</p><p><em>\\u2022 Unless otherwise stated, all the polls on this page are <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/budget.htm\">referenced here</a></em></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Fiscal+cliff&k=Barack+Obama&k=Obama+administration&k=Democrats&k=Republicans&k=US+Congress\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/400909392|2013-11-18T14:51:35Z|7c03df04526458ffa3ca95e83c0675b36c533d94 -->',\n",

But it doesn\\'t want to, at all, and for months military sources in Whitehall have been expressing deep unease about the situation to anyone who will listen.</p> <p>Their concern is that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>&nbsp;isn\\'t one of them. Buoyed by the success of the very limited campaign in Libya, and horrified by the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/07/cameron-obama-syria-top-priority?INTCMP=SRCH\">&nbsp;plight of refugees he met on the Syrian-Jordan border last month</a>, the prime minister has got a slight case of what some in Whitehall call &quot;foreign fever&quot;. Cameron wants &quot;to do something&quot;, they say, though he is not exactly sure what that something should be ...</p> <p>Nothing has changed the military\\'s reluctance to get involved in the Syrian crisis. Officers insist there must be clear and united political will over what to do before troops are committed \\u2013 and they want a robust and well thought-out exit strategy. Neither exists at the moment. The only scenario that would prompt the military into immediate action is the use of chemical weapons by Assad, or the prospect that some of them might end up in the wrong hands if his regime can longer protect them. At that point the UK would undoubtedly contribute to special forces operations to secure those weapons, following a US lead.</p> <p>Until then Richards will have to continue his slightly awkward tap dance in front of the prime minister. Offering some ideas, without committing to any of them, and cautioning that involving even a small number of British troops to a fourth campaign in a decade, at a time of restructuring and redundancy of the armed forces, in a region where the UK is not regarded as an honest broker, might be more trouble than it is worth.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T16:45:22.245Z\">at 4.45pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50c75261b579d49737370dfb\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T15:33:53.325Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Baricades breached</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Hundreds of protesters have <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Dec-11/198097-egypt-protesters-breach-presidential-palace-barricade.ashx#ixzz2El1x8HSX%20\">breached the barricade outside the presidential palace in&nbsp;Cairo</a>, according to reports.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sharifkouddous/status/278515855053180929\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Anti-Morsi protesters taking parts of concrete wall down near presidential palace.

Those inclined towards a boycott are the movements that are more pro-street and leftist.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the opposition would much rather the vote was postponed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They feel that in current climate, with all the violence that occurred and the deep division and polarisation, to have the referendum now is not the way to go. That\\u2019s the point of today\\u2019s protest - to pressure Morsi to postpone the referendum ... but I don\\u2019t expect this referendum to be postponed. Morsi is very headstrong about this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pro- and anti-Morsi protests today are due to start at 4pm local time (2pm GMT) in a similar area of Cairo.</p> <p>The area near the ministry of defence is heavily policed and Morsi\\u2019s opponents have agreed to shift the start of the march further down the road to avoid the prospect of clashes, Abdu explained. The anti-Morsi protesters will then be heading towards the presidential palace.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There should be no confrontation. I\\u2019m hoping that restraint is the name of day and there are no orders from [the Muslim Brotherhood\\u2019s] Freedom and Justice Party to march anywhere in the direction of opposition protesters, with tragic results like last Wednesday.</p> </blockquote> <p>It looks as if most of the judges will agree to oversee the referendum after concerns about their security have been met, Abdu said. Morsi\\u2019s widely-criticised decision to grant the army the power of arrest and detention ahead of the vote may have been made to satisfy the judges\\' security concerns, he said.</p> <p>Abdu added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everything that has happened since the Morsi decree can only be described, as in the favoured British parlance, as an \\'omnishambles\\'. You have midnight decrees, and 2am suspensions of tax hikes that were only released hours before. The whole thing has made a mockery of the democratic process. On paper Morsi has powers that only a despot can dream of. He has used and abused these powers in an erratic and unilateral manner which has bought us to this mess. What we are seeing now is a result of one of the most botched transition periods imaginable: a roadmap that was set by the military junta and aided and abetted by the Muslim Brotherhood, which left us open to all these legal wranglings and mess after mess.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T13:27:21.604Z\">at 1.27pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50c716cf95cbcfe457e3dbe4\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T11:45:24.564Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kurds agree to join Syrian opposition bloc</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A Kurdish opposition group, <a href=\"http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=556aeef60722f6e5811ea2519&amp;id=cb1a81716d&amp;e=dcaf978bc3\">the Kurdish National Council [KNC] has agreed to join the new Syrian opposition coalition</a> after securing guarantees about its representation in the bloc.</p> <p>An update from Ausama Monajed, a spokesman for the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, said the KNC\\'s leader Faisal Yusuf had accepted an offer to join the bloc.</p> <p>The coalition has agreed that 15% of the organisation can be Kurds.

In many cases the damage will be long-lasting, if not permanent. But it does not have to happen.&nbsp;</p> <p>We urge you to step forward and demonstrate that principled compromise is once again possible and that the American political system that underpinned the economic success of our nation and others can function as designed. For far too long, political paralysis has fueled global uncertainty that discourages businesses from investing and hiring new workers. This paralysis must come to an end, and in a way that resists the temptation to declare winners and losers.</p> <p>We pledge our active support for a compromise that includes comprehensive and meaningful tax and entitlement reforms that result in market-credible spending reductions and revenue growth. The deal should be a balanced solution to the fiscal cliff and long-term deficit and debt issues. To address these challenges with the scale of response required, no options should be precluded from a potential solution.</p> <p>Compromise will require Congress to agree on more revenue \\u2013 whether by increasing rates, eliminating deductions, or some combination thereof \\u2013 and the administration to agree to larger, meaningful structural and benefit entitlement reforms and spending reductions that are a fiscally responsible multiple of increased revenues. By initiating these reforms simultaneously, and without undermining the broader reforms both parties believe should be pursued, you can rebuild the trust needed for our political system to function and the confidence needed for businesses to invest in new factories, equipment, and employees. </p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T18:26:10.655Z\">at 1.26pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50c777a9b579d49737370e1e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T18:12:58.069Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>, the Democratic minority leader in the House, responded to <strong>John Boehner</strong>\\'s comments about the lack of detail in the Democratic proposals:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rebutting remarks that Speaker John Boehner made, the California Democrat said Obama and Democrats have in fact identified spending cuts they can support as part of a balanced plan to avert a &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; that threatens to send the economy into another recession.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-50c76fa9b579d49737370e1a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-11T17:38:49.791Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Crossroads GPS tries again</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Flushed with defeat from spending trillions of dollars on Mitt Romney\\'s losing campaign, the Karl Rove-led super pac<strong> Crossroads GPS</strong> is running a new ad targeting what it perceives to be soft touches \\u2013 in the form of Democratic senators Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia \\u2013 on the fiscal cliff.</p> <p>Coincidentally that list of Democratic senators is also the most vulnerable of those up for re-election in the next cycle.</p> <p>This is pretty dumb given that there\\'s nothing on the table yet.

The president and the Speaker of the House are negotiating in earnest, not in public, for a change.</p> </blockquote> <p>But before anyone starts popping champagne corks or spiking footballs, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE8A80WV20121211\">Reuters also reports</a> that there are few signs of actual progress on the content of a deal, despite the talks that continued yesterday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Neither side gave any public signs that they were ready to give ground.

At least 132 journalists were being held around the world on such charges.</p><p>Eritrea and Syria also ranked among the world\\'s worst, each jailing numerous journalists without charge or due process and holding them in secret prisons without access to lawyers or family members. In total, 63 journalists are being held without any publicly disclosed charge.</p><p>Here, country by country, are the 10 worst jailers\\u2026</p><h2>Turkey, the world\\'s worst jailer of journalists</h2><p>Turkey has 49 journalists behind bars, with dozens of Kurdish reporters and editors held on terror-related charges. A number of other journalists are detained on charges of involvement in anti-government plots. </p><p>In 2012, CPJ conducted an extensive review of imprisonments in Turkey and found that broadly worded anti-terror and penal code statutes have allowed the authorities to conflate the coverage of banned groups and the investigation of sensitive topics with outright terrorism or other anti-state activity.</p><p>These statutes \"make no distinction between journalists exercising freedom of expression and [individuals] aiding terrorism,\" said Mehmet Ali Birand, an editor with the Istanbul-based station Kanal D. He calls the use of anti-state laws against journalists a \"national disease.\" </p><p>Birand said \"the government does not differentiate between these two major things: freedom of expression and terrorism.\" </p><h2>Iran, the second-worst jailer</h2><p>Iran has 45 journalists behind bars following a sustained a crackdown that began after the disputed 2009 presidential election. The authorities have followed a pattern of freeing some detainees on six-figure bonds even as they make new arrests. </p><p>The imprisoned include Zhila Bani-Yaghoub, an award-winning editor of the Iranian Women\\'s Club, a news website focusing on women\\'s issues. She began serving a one-year term in September on charges of \"propagating against the regime\" and \"insulting the president\" for articles she wrote during the 2009 election. Her husband, journalist Bahman Ahmadi Amouee, is serving a five-year prison term on anti-state charges.</p><h2>China, the third-worst jailer</h2><p>China has made extensive use of anti-state charges to jail online writers expressing dissident political views and journalists covering ethnic minority groups. Nineteen of the 32 journalists held in China are Tibetans or Uighurs imprisoned for documenting ethnic tensions that escalated in 2008. </p><p>The detainees include Dhondup Wangchen, a documentary filmmaker jailed after interviewing Tibetans about their lives under Chinese rule. CPJ honoured Wangchen with one of its 2012 International Press Freedom Awards. </p><p>\"Journalists who report on areas deemed \\'most sensitive\\' by the state\\u2014China\\'s troubled ethnic regions of Tibet and Xinjiang\\u2014are most vulnerable,\" said Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. </p><p>\"Journalists living and working in those areas are not just concerned with the red lines set by the state for all journalists but also the shifting gray lines, where the Chinese government\\'s security footing is at an ongoing, all-time high.\"</p><h2>Eritrea: journalists arrested without charge</h2><p>Eritrea, with 28 journalists in detention, is the fourth-highest jailer. No Eritrean detainee has ever been publicly charged with a crime or brought before a court for trial.</p><p>President Isaias Afwerki\\'s government has refused to account for the whereabouts, legal status, or health of the jailed journalists, or even confirm reports that as many as five have died in custody due to inhumane treatment. </p><p>\"If you write anything contrary to what the state says, you end up in prison,\" said Bealfan Tesfay, who worked as a reporter and editor for a number of Eritrean state media outlets before fleeing the country. </p><h2>Syria: detainees held incommunicado</h2><p>At least 15 journalists are held by President Bashar al-Assad\\'s authorities, making the country the fifth-worst jailer. None of the detainees have been charged with a crime, and the authorities have been unwilling to account for the detainees\\' whereabouts or well-being.</p><p>Among those being held incommunicado is thought to be Austin Tice, a US freelancer who was reporting for the Washington Post and several other news outlets. \"As the uprising became more militarised, there was a greater risk of getting picked up,\" said Rania Abouzeid, a Beirut-based correspondent for Time magazine.</p><h2>Vietnam: cracking down on bloggers</h2><p>With 14 journalists behind bars, Vietnam was the sixth-worst jailer of the press. In each of the past several years, Vietnamese authorities have ramped up their crackdown on critical journalists, focusing heavily on those who work online. </p><p>All but one of the reporters imprisoned in 2012 published blogs or contributed to online news publications. And all but one were held on anti-state charges related to articles on politically sensitive topics such as the country\\'s relations with China and its treatment of the Catholic community.</p><h2>Azerbaijan: user of fabricated charges</h2><p>Azerbaijan, the world\\'s seventh-worst jailer, viciously cracked down on domestic dissent while hosting two major international events - the Eurovision 2012 song contest and the Internet Governance Forum. </p><p>The authorities imprisoned at least nine critical journalists on a variety of retaliatory charges, including hooliganism, drug possession, and extortion. CPJ concluded that the charges were fabricated in reprisal for the journalists\\' work.</p><h2>Ethiopia: \\'journalism is criminalised\\'</h2><p>With six journalists in prison, Ethiopia was the eighth-worst jailer in the world. The authorities broadened the scope of the country\\'s anti-terror law in 2009, criminalising the coverage of any group the government deems to be terrorist, a list that includes opposition political parties. </p><p>Among those jailed is Eskinder Nega, an award-winning blogger whose critical commentary on the government\\'s extensive use of anti-terror laws led to his own conviction on terrorism charges.</p><p>\"Basically, they are criminalising journalism,\" said Martin Schibbye, a Swedish freelance journalist who was jailed along with a colleague, Johan Persson, for more than 14 months in Ethiopia. </p><p>They were convicted of terrorism charges because they had travelled with a separatist group as part of research for a story. </p><h2>Uzbekistan: two have spent 13 years in prison</h2><p>Uzbekistan has four journalists in jail. They include Muhammad Bekjanov and Yusuf Ruzimuradov - the two longest-imprisoned journalists on CPJ\\'s survey - who were jailed in 1999 for publishing a banned newspaper. </p><h2>Saudi Arabia: columnist faces death penalty</h2><p>Saudi Arabia also has four journalists in jail. One of them, newspaper columnist Hamza Kashgari, faces a potential death penalty on religious insult charges stemming from Twitter postings that described a fanciful conversation with the Prophet Muhammad.</p><p>One imprisoned journalist, Iranian blogger Sattar Beheshti, died in custody. He was arrested in October on charges of \"acting against national security.\" Fellow prisoners said Beheshti, was beaten during interrogation and suspended from the ceiling.</p><h2>Now for the good news...</h2><p>For the first time since 1996, Burma is not among the nations jailing journalists. As part of the country\\'s transition to civilian rule, the authorities released at least 12 imprisoned journalists in a series of pardons over the past year.<br />     <br /><em><strong>NB:</strong></em> CPJ\\'s list is a snapshot of those incarcerated at 12:01am on 1 December 2012. It does not include the many journalists imprisoned and released throughout the year. And journalists who either disappear or are abducted by non-state entities, such as criminal gangs or militant groups, are not included in the census. </p><p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/reports/2012/12/imprisoned-journalists-world-record.php\">CPJ</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/media&k=Media&k=Journalist+safety&k=Press+freedom&k=World+news&k=Turkey&k=Iran\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/400858187|2013-11-18T14:51:35Z|565c807685d80ecf5b5a29627f2cac8e4a25bd93 -->',\n",

Not surprisingly, the Islamists willingly and enthusiastically jumped on the bandwagon.

You have to read the two laws [issued on 21 November and yesterday] in conjunction.</p> <p>The law also says the military have to hand the detainees to the ordinary judiciary for public prosecution but it says that is not withstanding the jurisidiction of the military judiciary.

One of his arguments is :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent package of decisions announced by the national dialogue team does not represent real compromise because the President has largely gotten what he wanted from his original constitutional declaration, even now as he rescinded it. In short, he has managed to let the constituent assembly finish its controversial draft constitution, despite walkouts from the assembly by all liberal members, feminist and human rights representatives, the Church, the advisory committee and more - leaving only Islamist forces and affiliates forming a total of 86 people on the final voting day.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/09/egypt-hopes-betrayed-mohamed-morsi\">On Comment is Free</a>, Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif says that Morsi has failed to deliver the basic demands of the revolution, which brought down Hosni Mubarak.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>President Morsi has been trying to please too many masters: his own Muslim Brotherhood, the other Islamists who find the Brotherhood not Islamist enough, the Americans, and the deep (or &quot;thick&quot; as the revolution calls it) state.</p> <p>The demands of the revolution were clear: bread, freedom, social justice. Concerning &quot;freedom&quot;, Morsi has refused to restructure the state\\'s security apparatus; he appointed as interior minister the man who\\'d been Cairo\\'s police chief in 2011 when protesters were massacred in the city\\'s streets. People continue to be killed in jail and in police stations across the country.</p> <p>Concerning the economy it\\'s become clear that the Brotherhood\\'s programme is basically Mubarak\\'s: Morsi visited China accompanied by some of the biggest business allies of Mubarak; the banking communities talk of deals already being made by high-ranking officials and their relatives, and borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank is suddenly not sinful. Meanwhile, the president is able to issue the wildest constitutional declarations but is unable to make the smallest step towards establishing minimum and maximum wages.</p> <p>So, his stance on security and the economy plays to the deep state and to the US. But most rank-and-file Islamists also want to see revolutionary change in economic ideology and security practices. How can he appease them? He throws them the bait that\\'s the staple of every demagogue preacher: we\\'ll clean up society, we\\'ll rule through the word of God. We will write the constitution and anyone who rejects it is against the word of God.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/09/egypt-revolutionary-responsibility-editorial\">A Guardian editorial argues</a> that the Muslim Brotherhood &quot;has lost sight of the need to bring along the whole spectrum of the forces which made the revolution&quot;. It goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some of it, but far from all, can be put down to inexperience, some to the unwillingness of elements of the opposition to compromise and, perhaps, in a few quarters, to a hope of unseating the president.</p> <p>None of it can be ascribed to the machinations of outside forces. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/world/middleeast/egypt-islamists-secular-opponents-clashes.html?pagewanted=all\">&quot;foreign hand&quot;</a>, Morsi should remember, is the last resort of the unscrupulous, or irrational, politician everywhere. His withdrawal of his controversial decree is not going to be enough to restore the calm and the trust Egypt needs, as the opposition\\'s rejection on Sunday of the constitutional referendum proposal showed. He should now be exploring what will be enough \\u2013 and working to convince the alienated that the constitution whose making is at the core of this crisis will not be a winner\\'s document but a charter that all Egyptians can accept.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-10T10:35:38.932Z\">at 10.35am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-50c5b1bab579d49737370cfc\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-10T09:56:20.941Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Good morning.

Should she decide to make a bid, her current popularity levels, at 61%, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/06/hillary-clinton-2016-democratic-primary-winner?INTCMP=SRCH\">would make her a shoo-in</a> for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>Gingrich\\'s frank words are revealing because they show how fearsome the Democratic trinity of the two Clintons and Obama appears to the Republicans. \"She is married to the most popular Democrat in the country. They both think it would be good for her to be president. That makes it virtually impossible to stop her for the nomination, I think,\" he said</p><p>Gingrich, who knows all about the terrifying powers of the Clintons having been Republican House speaker during the Bill Clinton administration, went further, saying that the Republican party in its current guise would be ill-equipped to take them on.</p><p>\"We didn\\'t blow it because of Mitt Romney,\" he told NBC. \"We blew it because of a party which has refused to engage the reality of American life and refused to think through what the average American needs for a better future.\"</p><p>Still, Gingrich\\'s penetrating soul-searching about the competence of the GOP to take back the White House appears not to extend to his own political suitability for the highest office. Asked whether he would put himself forward in 2016 he said: \"I doubt it,\" but then added: \"One never knows.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\\n        <iframe width=\"300px\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"NO\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Newt+Gingrich&k=Hillary+Clinton&k=Republicans&k=United+States&k=US+politics&k=Democrats\" style=\"border: none\">\\n          <a href=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\n              <img src=\"http://oas.theguardian.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" />\\n          </a>\\n        </iframe>\\n      </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/400779963|2013-11-18T14:51:35Z|f0bf74b7cb7272ec0790e40ad9d0e64c77bdc7b1 -->',\n",
