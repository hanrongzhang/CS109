Under the law, a person without an ID on Election Day would submit a provisional ballot and have six days to produce the required ID for the vote to count.

First, Ryan is synonymous with economic policy. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Ryan's ideas, he brings a serious debate on the economy to the campaign. Romney desperately needs to get the political dialogue back to the economy, and Ryan's selection is designed to do just that. In other words, Ryan was not brought in to win over Democrats and independents - although some deficit-minded ones will be attracted to him - he was brought in to make voters feel good about the conservative brand and to get large numbers of conservatives to the polls on election night. Since Ryan and Romney agree on almost all policy issues, Ryan doesn't bring anything new policy-wise to the ticket that will attract new voters. But what Ryan does do is give more credibility to Romney's conservatism, which will energize the Republican base for Romney's campaign.","Ryan Selection Targets Conservatives, Wallets",The Times - Tribune

Four years later, all that love has resulted in moving their childhood bedroom furniture to mom and dad's basement while working part time.

Obama came of age during the post-'60s poisonous strain of liberalism where American exceptionalism was scoffed and slandered. In its place, adhering to the credo of big government and reviling capitalism was not only celebrated, but embraced. Obama's anti-exceptionalism posture defines his ""leading from behind"" foreign policy where deferring to a coalition like the United Nations is ideal. Obama does not believe in the U.S. as a world leader or as a beacon of freedom. Our nation has done more for liberty and freedom than any other country on the face of the earth. When first in office, Obama was asked if he believed in American Exceptionalism. He stated just the same way other countries think they're exceptional. The legacy of our American Exceptionalism is not to be abandoned for the insipidness of national statism. Most Americans believe our nation is exceptional. The problem is we have a chief executive who doesn't and never will. To Obama, the United States is fundamentally belligerent, prejudicial and racist. Obama abhors free enterprise and harangued against what he conceived was excessive capitalism when he described working in the private sector ""as serving behind enemy lines.""

From 1954 through (at least) 2010, Republican governors have followed Democratic governors like clockwork, two terms apiece, eight years apart. - The incumbency effect observes that the party switches occur only when Pennsylvania's term-limited governors can't run again, concluding that the powerful presence of an incumbent on the ballot creates the eight-year cycle. So if [Romney] does win in 2012, the Pennsylvania electorate in 2014 will confront an incumbent governor of the president's party for only the second time in 60 years.

In Bradford County, the Democrats fail to put up many candidates for many offices. In many cases ""red blooded"" Republicans run in the Democratic column! In a previous election for prothonotary, Gerard Zeller ran as a Democrat while attending Republican functions. Now another ""Republican"" defector is asking to be accepted by the Democrats as their candidate for prothonotary. Does Mr. Schultz posses the ideology of a Democrat? Or is it just a farce? Why would any Democrat vote for Schultz who apparently sponsored a sign at a Republican golf fund raiser? That money is forcing the local Democrats to spend extra money to keep Mark Smith as a county commissioner and to try to elect Gene Osmun. And now Republicans are forced to spend extra money to defeat the ""Republican"" defector which could have gone to elect Doug McLinko, Daryl Miller! This is madness! So that's why I'm voting for [Sally Fairchild Vaughn] for Prothonotary and Clerk of Courts. EDITOR: Next Tuesday, Nov. 8 I'll be voting for Sally Vaughn for prothonotary. I've known Sally for a long time now and I'm familiar with how complicated the work is that is performed in the prothonotary office. Having gone to nearly all the forums in the spring and hearing what her opponent had to say, I can honestly say from his own comments that he doesn't have the experience or expertise to manage the prothonotary office. Sally has made sure the prothonotary office has been kept up to date technologically, the main reason why many records in the office were not lost forever in the recent flood. Sally looks out for the employees in her office and I've seen the loyalty they show her. It's important to know that while the prothonotary office is not funded by property taxes, Sally is always looking out for taxpayers. On Election Day I'll be spending my two votes for county commissioner on Doug McLinko and Daryl Miller. I know all of the candidates for commissioner and it all comes down to who I trust the most to look out for taxpayers. I'm especially reminded of the Clean & Green roll-back tax issue and my own personal involvement at the commissioner meetings. Rolling back property taxes on entire parcels of farm land would have been devastating to the majority of farmers in Bradford County. Doug McLinko opposed rolling back taxes on entire farm acreages except the small areas where gas drilling was happening. Mark Smith not only wanted entire parcels rolled back, he was quite irate that I and others opposed him on that issue. That issue, here in Bradford County, was instrumental in getting Clean & Green legislation passed preventing counties from rolling back taxes on entire farms. Doug McLinko looked out for taxpayers he knew could be bankrupted and at that time I know Daryl Miller agreed with Doug and myself on the roll-back issue. Mark kept telling me ""it's the rules so we have to do it,"" farmers be damned. I've had other issues with Mark Smith the past three years and if I didn't agree with Mark his response has invariably been to lash out in anger, something that seems to be common in his position as chairman of the commissioners.

For Democrats the most recent, if not most egregious, bad convention was the 1968 edition held in Chicago. There, the party, amidst rioting in the streets, fist fights on the convention floor and acrimonious debate among delegates, nominated a fatally damaged candidate (Hubert Humphrey) who went on to lose to Richard Nixon in November. Democrats staged an encore convention four years later in 1972 when a badly divided, poorly managed party nominated George McGovern. He eventually lost by one of the most lopsided tallies in modern times. The first dates back to 1860 when Democrats met for their Charleston convention, only to adjourn in deadlock unable to nominate a candidate. This contentious convention led to a split of the party into northern and southern wings, each of which eventually nominated different candidates at later conventions. Most historians believe the Democrats' schism contributed significantly to the outbreak of the Civil War. It also guaranteed the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps the most famous example of a party convention gone awry occurred in 1912. This time it was Republicans battling the forces of party discord. A raging battle between incumbent William Howard Taft and former president Teddy Roosevelt ripped the GOP apart at their Chicago convention. The Taft forces eventually renominated their candidate, but the outraged Roosevelt bolted the convention with his supporters to run as a third party candidate.

Pennsylvania said it is widening the scope of water tests to screen for radioactive pollutants and other contaminants from the state's booming natural gas drilling industry. The state Department of Environmental Protection's acting secretary, Michael Krancer, wrote Wednesday to the Environmental Protection Agency to say that he has requested additional testing from some public water suppliers and wastewater treatment facilities. Those steps, he said, were in the works before the EPA's regional administrator, Shawn Garvin, sent a March 7 letter asking Pennsylvania to begin more water testing to make sure drinking water isn't being contaminated by drillers. The state's requests for additional testing, however, were made later in March. Mr. [Barack Obama] hailed the deal as ""the biggest annual spending cut in history."" House Speaker John Boehner said that over the next decade it would cut government spending by $500 billion, and won an ovation from his rank and file - tea party adherents among them.

He has engaged students and has always encouraged young people to not only ""talk the talk,"" but to act on their beliefs and ""walk the walk"" to bring about positive social change. Recently, Laureen Cummings, the Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, proposed the idea of a national sales tax. Cummings has been campaigning on a platform of supposedly helping the middle class but such an idea would seriously harm the middle class. If implemented, a national sales tax would be a regressive tax that hurts low- and middle-income Americans more than it does the wealthiest Americans. The overwhelming majority of economists agree with this assessment because the truth is that low- and middle-income taxpayers spend more of their hard-earned income on goods and services than wealthy taxpayers. William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has criticized the sales tax for its regressive nature, pointing to the fact that ""low- and middle-income households consume more of their income than high-income households do."" Therefore, this tax would disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans while having little to no effect on the wealthiest Americans who ultimately save more of their income than any other tax bracket. Furthermore, there is no evidence that a national sales tax would boost government revenue in a meaningful way. The net gain in federal revenue would be minimal compared to the impact of repealing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent - which would net $700 billion. Ultimately, the national sales tax is a flawed idea that hurts low- and middle-income Americans and it is an idea rejected by most economists, The Wall Street Journal, and even Mitt Romney.",Your Voice: Letters To The Editor Gene Stilp For Congress Cummings Wrong On Sales Tax End Sky-rocketing Property Taxes Mundy No Help On Tax Reduction Mundy Runs A Clean Campaign,Citizens' Voice

Indeed, the 2000 Electoral College popular vote split inspired much of the deep animosities now so redolent in contemporary politics. Nor is an Electoral College misfire the end of it or even the worst of it. The combination of a razor thin tight election compounded by new tougher and controversial voter ID laws means that at least six key states, possibly more, could end up election night without a clear winner. One of these is Obama's likely underperformance among some key voter groups who favor him: Hispanics, younger voters, and women. Hispanics and young voters seem far less motivated to vote this year, and Obama looks like he will fall short of the majorities he won among them four years ago. His eroding support among women in large part explains the tightening of the contest since the first debate. The ongoing defection of these key groups conceivably makes it hard for Obama to beat Romney in the popular vote. The fly in the ointment, however, for Romney is that Obama still has small leads in a number of battleground states. If Romney wins Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, which now seem likely, he still needs Ohio or Pennsylvania, which seem less likely. And if Obama defeats Romney in those large electoral vote states, Romney will then need some combination of several of the other swing states: Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Colorado Nevada and Iowa, to win the Electoral College. In short, a Romney popular vote victory has the ring of a real possibility while Obama seems better positioned to win in the Electoral College.","Some See Romney Taking Popular Vote, But Obama Winning Re-election With Electoral College",The News - Item

The law's goal, to prevent voter fraud, enjoys universal support, yet doubt exists that much fraud actually exists. The law's purpose appears to be a sham. Its stated objective, to prevent voter fraud, seems to be a classic case of a solution looking for a problem. Evidence of significant voter fraud is virtually nonexistent. Nationally, not a single person was found guilty of impersonating another voter between 2002 and 2007 (the latest data available). A GOP advocacy group last year did identify 400 fraud prosecutions over the previous decade. Even if true, however, this would still be less than one fraud a year per state. In Pennsylvania alone, there have been only four fraud convictions over the last eight years, none of which would have been prevented by the new law. The law is politically motivated. Voter suppression (i.e., discouraging certain groups from voting) is apparently the real motivation of the law. Republicans have frantically denied this, but their own House majority leader publicly acknowledged it last month. Showing perhaps more candor than canniness, Rep.
