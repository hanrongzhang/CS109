This spring, for the first time since I started writing about politics a decade ago, I found myself completely depressed by a campaign.

A few years ago, it was probably possible to fit every living Hayekian in a conference room. Regardless of what happens in November, that will no longer be the case. Hayek's ideas aren't completely new to American politics. Some mainstream Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, have name-checked him since at least the 1980s as a shorthand way of signaling their unfettered faith in the free market and objection to big government. But few actually engaged with Hayek's many contentious (and outré) views, particularly his suspicion of all politicians, including Republicans, who claim to know something about how to make an economy function better. For these reasons, and others, Hayek has become fashionable of late among antigovernment protesters, and if Ryan brings even a watered-down version of his ideas into the Republican mainstream, the country's biggest battles about the economy won't be between right and left, but within the Republican Party itself -- between Tea Party radicals who may feel legitimized and the establishment politicians they believe stand in their way.",Magazine Desk,2012-08-21T00:00:00Z,,Will Friedrich von Hayek be the Tea Party’s Karl Marx?,The New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/magazine/prime-time-for-paul-ryans-guru-the-one-thats-not-ayn-rand.html,1303
