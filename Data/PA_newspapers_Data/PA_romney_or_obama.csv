871,Anonymous,"Aug 5, 2011",Opinion,928,"EDITOR: In the period between World War II and about 1972, the United States was the only economic superpower of the world. Period. Why, we made stuff. Cars, TV's, furniture, you name it, we manufactured it here and shipped it all over the world. Manufacturing gave us money, a solid economy, job growth, medical care, homes and secure mortgages. When the gas crunch hit, and Toyotas and Datsuns got a foothold in the United States, and a very dangerous trend started, manufacturing began moving out of the United States. In the early 70s I recall calling things made in Japan ""Jap Scrap"" the tools were terrible, the cars were economical, but otherwise junk. However, cash began to flow into the Japanese economy, and they improved to the point where their quality and cost competitiveness could not be matched by anyone in the world. Soon, everything was made in Japan, and the first brick was removed from the United States foundation of manufacturing. Japan is a country of just over 100 million people (about one-third the size of the US). Once everyone in Japan had a manufacturing job, their wages began to rise as employers needed to pay more to attract employees. However, pretty soon their labor rate was the same as ours, so there was no benefit to manufacturing in Japan anymore, so they opened plants in Ohio and Tennessee. About this time NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was discussed and H. Ross Perot coined the phrase ""The giant sucking sound of jobs going to Mexico."" I personally witnessed the frenzy of manufacturing plant construction in Mexico just prior to NAFTA approval - again, jobs were moving out of the United States.","Letters To The Editor, Aug. 6, 2011",The Daily Review

1279,,"Oct 28, 2012",Opinion,1004,"Recently, Laureen Cummings, the Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, proposed the idea of a national sales tax. Cummings has been campaigning on a platform of supposedly helping the middle class but such an idea would seriously harm the middle class. If implemented, a national sales tax would be a regressive tax that hurts low- and middle-income Americans more than it does the wealthiest Americans. The overwhelming majority of economists agree with this assessment because the truth is that low- and middle-income taxpayers spend more of their hard-earned income on goods and services than wealthy taxpayers. William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has criticized the sales tax for its regressive nature, pointing to the fact that ""low- and middle-income households consume more of their income than high-income households do."" Therefore, this tax would disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans while having little to no effect on the wealthiest Americans who ultimately save more of their income than any other tax bracket. Furthermore, there is no evidence that a national sales tax would boost government revenue in a meaningful way. The net gain in federal revenue would be minimal compared to the impact of repealing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent - which would net $700 billion. Ultimately, the national sales tax is a flawed idea that hurts low- and middle-income Americans and it is an idea rejected by most economists, The Wall Street Journal, and even Mitt Romney.",Your Voice: Letters To The Editor Gene Stilp For Congress Cummings Wrong On Sales Tax End Sky-rocketing Property Taxes Mundy No Help On Tax Reduction Mundy Runs A Clean Campaign,Citizens' Voice

To make matters worse, a long line of big companies are threatening to make all their employees part time and drop their insurance coverage which will ultimately end up creating the single payer government run insurance that he promised he wouldn't do.
