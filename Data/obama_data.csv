He went on to say, ""Now, I mention Joe, first of all, because he loves Scranton. He was born here in Scranton. He spent his early years here in Scranton. This town helped make him who he is. This is a town where he and so many of you grew up with faith in an America where hard work matters. Where responsibility matters. Where if you stay true to those things, you can get ahead. Where no matter who you are, no matter what you look like - whether you own a factory or you work on the factory floor - America is a place where you can make it if you try.""

34750,34750,"In 2005, Congress raised the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. It was an outrageous sum at the time, but that was six years ago. Since then, the debt has increased an unprecedented 64 percent. That's a pretty sizeable iceberg that's no longer on the horizon, but directly in front of us. Apparently those who help comprise the world's greatest legislative body can't see it, and if they do, they have been ignoring it at the country's peril. Only two Congressmen have come forth with proposals. How's that for leadership. Guess who voted against raising the debt ceiling in 2006 and then went on grandstanding, ""Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership."" If you said the freshman senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, grab yourself a lifejacket. But you're going to need more than that - the water's really cold and filled with deep thinking sharks. Those sharks are politicos like Howard Dean whose aspiration is failure and a government shutdown. Dean believes such will play right into the Democratic tank like it did in 1995. Dean said last week that if he were still running the Democratic National Committee, he'd be ""quietly rooting for"" a shutdown because, ""I know who's going to get blamed - we've been down this road before.""

Bennett]'s Feb. 8 letter, ""Self-defeaters,"" reeks of this type of thinking. A good example of this is his comment on the deficit. Sure it ballooned during the [George W. Bush] administration but it has tripled in the two plus years that the very liberal [Barack Obama] has been if office. He also attacks ""the Generals"" as being talking heads. I wonder if he knows the military serve at the will of the people. That war is the province of government, that only Congress can declare war. I wish he would put a name on his demon horde of ""ultracons"" if for no other reason but to see the face of this evil.

Frog's take: Seems about the same, but many are larger than our average ad. As it is for any publication, advertising helps us stay in business.

They guessed $18 million - twice what CKE spent last year building new restaurants. Obamacare must mean fewer restaurants. CKE restaurants have a 95 percent employee turnover in a year - not bad in this industry - and the health care benefits under CKE's current ""mini-med"" plans are capped in a way that makes them illegal under Obamacare.
