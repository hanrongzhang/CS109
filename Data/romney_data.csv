29113,"The Newt Surge, deserving as it is of Uppercase Respect, has thrown everyone off - except, that is, Gingrich, who seems to be savoring his own inevitability. But of course he's leading the polls. He dominates in debates. He's been there, done that. He's even nice to his opponents, refusing to criticize them or play along with moderators, who, in addition to being members of the loathed mainstream media, are intellectual chicken hawks trying to stir up a fight that they can then smugly condemn. The conundrum for the heretofore unmentioned front-runner, Mitt Romney, is to determine whether Gingrich's rise is a mere appetizer to Romney's eventual banquet, or is a serious threat to his presumed nomination. Romney may have a more serious problem than is conceivable given the trolley of baggage that Gingrich has to drag around. The largest pieces include: taking huge sums in consulting fees from Freddie Mac; ethics violations from his days as speaker of the House; an extramarital affair with a Hill staffer, his now-wife Callista, while he was trying to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about his extramarital dalliance with an intern. Gingrich's rise may indicate a populace that considers the nation's challenges more important than personal foibles. Or, more likely, his surge is an affirmation of the Republican base's preference for a good ol' boy from the South rather than an exotic from a vacation reef out in the middle of the ocean.",,2011-12-03,Republicans Show They Can Love A Sinner,Opinion,The Times - Tribune,762.0,29113,Romney

29191,"In February, billionaire Donald (Look-at-How-Wonderful-I-Am) Trump, an unabashed Birther, stood next to multi-millionaire Mitt [Ann Romney] in a Las Vegas casino and endorsed him for the Republican nomination. A few months earlier, Trump had gotten significant face-time in the media while flirting with the idea of running for the presidency while whining about Romney. ""He'd buy companies. He'd close companies. He'd get rid of jobs,"" Trump crowed. But now, with Romney running well ahead in the primary contests, Trump was trying to be relevant and stay in the political spotlight. Romney, for his part, smiled and said nothing to suggest that Trump could be wrong about pursuing the birther argument. Trying to have everyone like him, one of the most unlikable presidential candidates refused to repudiate Trump's birther views. At first, the flip-flopping Romney said he didn't plan to release the returns. Then he said, ""maybe."" Then he declared he'd release only the previous two years' returns. Then he said that because of the complexity of the return, he filed for an extension from the IRS so he could file after the April 15 deadline for the 2011 return. Then this past week before a fundraiser, he said he ""never paid less than 13 percent. ... So I paid taxes every single year."" He expected us just to believe him. He never defined whether that was just income taxes, or included all taxes paid, including social security, local, and state taxes, thus making the federal income tax even lower. Why Romney won't release tax returns prior to 2010 may be because secrets are buried in 2009. According to BuzzFlash's Mark Karlin, citing Lawrence O'Donnell's pointed queries, ""Romney may have taken advantage of a 2009 IRS amnesty period to disclose hidden income in offshore accounts but subject to U.S. taxation. The amnesty offer allowed such persons to escape potential criminal prosecution for tax evasion.""

The reforms brought on by the changes in the education system put the students in Massachusetts on the track to higher academic achievement. When Romney became the governor in 2003 that academic achievement continued until he left office. In fact, he upped the ante and worked to have science added to the required statewide assessment system. He also continued the practice of exit testing all seniors in the public school system.

This is the 60-year pattern in gubernatorial elections that witnesses the Republican and Democratic parties switching control of the governor's office every eight years. From 1954 through (at least) 2010, Republican governors have followed Democratic governors like clockwork, two terms apiece, eight years apart. - The incumbency effect observes that the party switches occur only when Pennsylvania's term-limited governors can't run again, concluding that the powerful presence of an incumbent on the ballot creates the eight-year cycle. So if [Romney] does win in 2012, the Pennsylvania electorate in 2014 will confront an incumbent governor of the president's party for only the second time in 60 years. The other time it happened was Republican Dick Thornburgh's re-election race in 1982. That election was the closest contest involving an incumbent governor in modern times.

So if [Romney] does win in 2012, the Pennsylvania electorate in 2014 will confront an incumbent governor of the president's party for only the second time in 60 years.

29926,"I currently teach courses in social work and sociology at Luzerne County Community College, and Penn State, Temple and Marywood Universities. [Gene Stilp] has been a guest lecturer in my classes on numerous occasions. He has engaged students and has always encouraged young people to not only ""talk the talk,"" but to act on their beliefs and ""walk the walk"" to bring about positive social change. Recently, Laureen Cummings, the Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, proposed the idea of a national sales tax. Cummings has been campaigning on a platform of supposedly helping the middle class but such an idea would seriously harm the middle class. If implemented, a national sales tax would be a regressive tax that hurts low- and middle-income Americans more than it does the wealthiest Americans. The overwhelming majority of economists agree with this assessment because the truth is that low- and middle-income taxpayers spend more of their hard-earned income on goods and services than wealthy taxpayers. William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has criticized the sales tax for its regressive nature, pointing to the fact that ""low- and middle-income households consume more of their income than high-income households do."" Therefore, this tax would disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans while having little to no effect on the wealthiest Americans who ultimately save more of their income than any other tax bracket. Furthermore, there is no evidence that a national sales tax would boost government revenue in a meaningful way. The net gain in federal revenue would be minimal compared to the impact of repealing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent - which would net $700 billion. Ultimately, the national sales tax is a flawed idea that hurts low- and middle-income Americans and it is an idea rejected by most economists, The Wall Street Journal, and even Mitt Romney.",,2012-10-28,Your Voice: Letters To The Editor Gene Stilp For Congress Cummings Wrong On Sales Tax End Sky-rocketing Property Taxes Mundy No Help On Tax Reduction Mundy Runs A Clean Campaign,Opinion,Citizens' Voice,1004.0,29926,Romney

30355,"Understanding this peculiar electoral enigma requires familiarity with Pennsylvania's famous (or infamous) ""eight-year cycle."" This is the 60-year pattern in gubernatorial elections that witnesses the Republican and Democratic parties switching control of the governor's office every eight years. From 1954 through (at least) 2010, Republican governors have followed Democratic governors like clockwork, two terms apiece, eight years apart. Statistics indicate persuasively that the eight-year cycle is not a fluke. The probability that this string of 15 gubernatorial elections is just a random occurrence is less than 0.000141 percent. That's about equivalent to shooting a hole-in-one, being struck by lightning, or Earth being in a catastrophic collision with an asteroid in the next century. It could happen, but it won't. So if [Romney] does win in 2012, the Pennsylvania electorate in 2014 will confront an incumbent governor of the president's party for only the second time in 60 years. The other time it happened was Republican Dick Thornburgh's re-election race in 1982. That election was the closest contest involving an incumbent governor in modern times.

30600,"Enacted this spring, it unleashed a cascade of contention since Gov. Tom Corbett signed it in March. It has been hailed, assailed, praised, condemned, defended, attacked, cursed and blessed. Most Pennsylvanians like it, according to polls, although the same polls suggest many don't understand it well. The law's goal, to prevent voter fraud, enjoys universal support, yet doubt exists that much fraud actually exists. The law's purpose appears to be a sham. Its stated objective, to prevent voter fraud, seems to be a classic case of a solution looking for a problem. Evidence of significant voter fraud is virtually nonexistent. Nationally, not a single person was found guilty of impersonating another voter between 2002 and 2007 (the latest data available). A GOP advocacy group last year did identify 400 fraud prosecutions over the previous decade. Even if true, however, this would still be less than one fraud a year per state. In Pennsylvania alone, there have been only four fraud convictions over the last eight years, none of which would have been prevented by the new law. The law is politically motivated. Voter suppression (i.e., discouraging certain groups from voting) is apparently the real motivation of the law. Republicans have frantically denied this, but their own House majority leader publicly acknowledged it last month. Showing perhaps more candor than canniness, Rep. Mike Turzai implied the law had the partisan goal of winning the presidential election for Mitt Romney.

This is all unlikely to be decided before Election Day, so if you're planning to vote Nov. 6, you'll probably have to show a valid ID, but don't bet on a different outcome for the election. Well, they do, and it didn't really matter until 1992, when Democrats began their streak of five straight wins by their presidential candidates in the Keystone State, a streak now fed by the rush of Democrats to Philly's suburbs.
